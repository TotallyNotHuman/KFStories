## 17 – Farewell, Relay
Three Years Later – KD 9032.3

Edgun lay in his bunk, gazing longingly at the gargantuan station through his cabin&#39;s &#39;porthole&#39;, which was really just a visual feed that looked like a porthole. Like everybody else, he was feeling nostalgic, and for a very good reason. For the last decade, this station had been their entire world. Some scientists had decorated their cabins and research terminals, really making this alien station _home_. But now, all that was gone. The day before they were due to depart for Kerbin again, the interior of Relay Alpha had been restored to how the crew had found it – undecorated and bare. Relay Alpha was once again just an ordinary station orbiting an otherwise ordinary star.

Another thing dominated the thoughts of the crew: the thought of entering stasis. While the prospect of being dropped into a vat of liquid nitrogen and flash-frozen was none too appealing, it was either that or age an additional ten years. Even the youngest crewkerbs aboard were now nearing their forties, and frankly, entering stasis seemed much more appealing than aging ten years.

His comm chimed. &quot;_CIC to the Captain._&quot; &quot;Go ahead.&quot; &quot;_Captain, preflight checks complete, both here and on the_ Scorpion_; medical staff on both sides report stasis pods will be ready after departure. We&#39;re ready for departure, pending your go, sir._&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be at the CIC in five. Patch me through to Captain Munwise once I get there.&quot;

&quot;_Aye, sir. CIC out._&quot;

Edgun rose from his bunk, smoothed out the wrinkles on his duty jumpsuit, and headed for the CIC. 

---

&quot;Captain on deck,&quot; Dorod announced respectfully. &quot;I have that transmission you requested.&quot;

&quot;On screen,&quot; Edgun ordered. The viewscreen came to life, displaying a video feed of the _Scorpion_&#39;s CIC, along with all the holographic panels the consoles sported.

Enman whistled under his breath. &quot;I&#39;d like to get my hands on one of _those_ consoles,&quot; he muttered

&quot;_Captain, both vessels are at departure readiness_,&quot; Munwise reported. &quot;_We are ready for superluminal flight; as you are the senior officer in this system, I defer to your good judgement, sir._&quot;

&quot;_Scalpel_, _Scorpion_: maneuver to cruise formation alpha; lay in a course to Kerbin and translate to layer 7 when ready,&quot; Edgun ordered. Both conn officers maneuvered the helm expertly, and the ships were now parallel to each other in hyperspace.

&quot;_Course laid in and cruise formation reached, Captain_,&quot; Dorod and Debchel replied in unison.

&quot;_Scorpion_, prime fusion drive at half power output; _Scalpel_, prime fusion drive, full power output.&quot;

The conn officers did so, and the characteristic purring of a fusion drive being primed reverberated throughout both ships&#39; CICs. As the purring increased in pitch, a proton fusion reaction slowly began to build up in the engine bells.

&quot;_Priming sequence complete, Captain,_&quot; the conn officers reported, waiting for Edgun to issue the command which would activate the drive systems of both ships.

&quot;Engage,&quot; he said softly.

Both conn officers tapped a button of some sort – whether holographic or physical – and the drive systems started up. Both ships&#39; drives accelerated their respective ships by two millimeters per second squared; in realspace, this corresponded to about 25.6 centimeters per second squared. At first glance, it was a paltry amount of acceleration; but then again, it was powerful enough to accelerate the ships to superluminal speeds, so they probably wouldn&#39;t be superseded any time soon. Once both ships were underway, both captains ordered their crew – except for medical staff – to report to their ships&#39; sickbay. Since Edgun&#39;s crew was unfamiliar with entering stasis, he had to give them a very brief briefing on being dropped into a vat of liquid nitrogen and flash-frozen. Which, understandably, frightened some of the crewkerbs with less bravado than their braver counterparts. Those ranked lower in the command hierarchy were put in stasis first, then the higher-ranking officers; before the captains of their respective ships entered stasis, they had communicated one last time – their last communication, until they would be released from their dreamless sleep ten years later.

&quot;Ah, Captain. So it all comes down to this,&quot; Edgun joked. &quot;We&#39;ll be flash-frozen, at which point the antifreeze is supposed to keep us alive.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Munwise played along. &quot;Though you mustn&#39;t worry; these pods are quite safe. They could put a _kitten_ into stasis and revive her.&quot; He was not joking; suspended animation technology was _that_ advanced.

&quot;I&#39;ll take your word for it,&quot; Edgun answered. &quot;If I fail to wake up, you will not hear the end of it,&quot; he joked. Both parties laughed.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you in a few, Captain,&quot; Munwise said. He was actually serious; the kerbal body could not perceive time while in suspended animation. From an outsider&#39;s point of view, time would pass normally; however, from the viewpoint of a kerbal entering and being released from stasis, the process was instantaneous. In other words, a kerbal entering stasis would be reawakened after only a moment, when in reality an unspecified amount of time had passed.

The chief medical officers of both ships injected the sedative-antifreeze mix, and helped the captains into their pods; the pods were flooded with liquid nitrogen, and nothing more needed to be said. As both ships left their wakes in the fabric of space-time, the collective crew of the _Scalpel_ and _Scorpion_ rested peacefully but dreamlessly, safely outside the constantly flowing river of time. Without them, time and space continued to expand into the void.
