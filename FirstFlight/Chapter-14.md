## 14 – _Scorpion_ Emerging

Central Information Center, KFS _Scorpion_
six Days Later – KD 8269.7

_&quot;All hands,&quot;_ Debchel said through the comm, &quot;_brace for fluid braking. Repeat. All hands, brace for fluid braking._&quot;

The young conn officer turned to Munwise, who again had taken up his chair. &quot;We&#39;re approaching the fluid braking point, Captain,&quot; she said.

&quot;Well, what are you waiting for?&quot; asked Munwise. Debchel nodded and returned her gaze to her console. With a push of the button, she engaged the fluid braking sequence – which would initiate the inertial coupling field, activate the translation drive, disengage the engines, and open the ramscoops. The console asked for a confirmation, and Debchel did so; a holographic button with a cover was projected, the cover was flipped open, and the button was pressed.

The _Scorpion_ tumbled slightly as it descended into layer 10 space. A much larger shockwave rocked the ship as the far more viscous spatial fluid slammed against the ship like a brick wall. In actuality, the ship was decelerating at 20000 meters per second squared, almost 2038 _g_; should the inertial coupling fields have failed then and there, the entire crew complement of the _Scorpion_ would be converted into a thin green paste and smeared onto every bulkhead facing Relay II. That was simply an unavoidable risk; to decelerate conventionally on their rockets would take exactly the amount of time it took them to get up to speed, and they would miss the rendezvous by a long stretch. Controlling the deceleration so that the ship decelerated at one _g_ would increase the deceleration time to eight hours; while certainly not an inconvenience, the ship would simply whiz past Relay II, and require additional course corrections to be made in order to intercept the planet again. In any case, the inertial couplers kept the gravity aboard at a comfortable 1 _g_; anything the coupling field couldn&#39;t compensate for were reduced by about 98 percent, so any spikes would just cause the gravity to fluctuate by several tenths of a _g_ – nothing too lethal, just a bit of rocking about and perhaps some motion sickness.

&quot;Field stability at 99 percent and holding,&quot; an ensign from one of the multifunctional consoles reported. &quot;Deceleration holding steady at 20000 meters per second per second.&quot;

&quot;T minus four minutes, forty-five seconds and counting to orbital velocity,&quot; another chimed in. &quot;Current speed is 5,680 kilometers per second and decreasing.&quot;

Precisely four minutes and forty-five seconds later, Debchel engaged the translation drive again, and the _Scorpion_ emerged from hyperspace. Its speed of two kilometers per second that it had retained from its travels in hyperspace was just enough to cause the planet to capture it. Relay II&#39;s gravity curved its trajectory, ensuring a stable, albeit somewhat eccentric and inclined orbit.

&quot;We are in orbit, sir,&quot; reported Debchel. &quot;I&#39;m reading an orbit of 190 by 310 kilometers, inclined by fifteen degrees to the ecliptic plane.&quot;

&quot;Hail the _Scalpel_, Ensign.&quot;

---

&quot;Captain – incoming hail from the _Scorpion_, sir,&quot; Dorod reported.

&quot;Open a channel,&quot; Edgun replied smoothly. He stood, and walked to the front of the viewscreen.

The viewscreen came to life, and displayed the image of the _Scorpion_&#39;s CIC, as well as Munwise&#39;s face.

&quot;_Good to see you, Captain_.&quot;

&quot;Likewise, Captain. You have arrived in orbit of Relay II, I presume?&quot; asked Edgun professionally.

&quot;_Yes, Captain. However, our orbit is slightly eccentric and inclined, and we will have to rendezvous with you. The mining and refining equipment has been loaded onto the shuttle_ Cochrane_, and it is ready for deployment. We just need to rendezvous with the_ Scalpel _first, as you are in an equatorial orbit_,&quot; replied Munwise.

&quot;Very well. Once you have rendezvoused with us and entered a station-keeping orbit, you can deploy the mining equipment. My first officer and chief engineer, Commander Enman, shall be there to assist your chief engineer in the deployment process. He and I shall come aboard before the deployment process.&quot;

&quot;_Thank you, Captain. I believe my chief engineer will appreciate the help. She&#39;s been overworked lately,_&quot; Munwise said gratefully.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that. Well, Captain, if there isn&#39;t anything else that can wait until our meeting, I suppose I&#39;ll terminate the link,&quot; Edgun said. &quot;Safe travels, Captain.&quot;

&quot;_I shall see you in a few moments, Captain. Munwise out._&quot;

---

The _Scorpion_&#39;s fission fragment drives ignited, spewing molten fissile material, and matched relative velocities with the _Scalpel_. Because the ramscoops were used for circumstellar navigation only, the FFDs would be used while the ship was inside a gravity well, such as their current situation. After correcting the relative velocity, the drive systems shut down.

&quot;Conn, go for standard station-keeping orbit, target KFS _Scalpel_,&quot; Munwise ordered. Debchel nodded, and brought up a holographic RCS control system. This was also one of the upgrades to the _Scalpel_-class refit CIC; some, but not all, ship controls could be controlled using holographic controls.

The bow thrusters sputtered once, clearing their manifolds; then, a bright orange plume issued forth from the nozzles, inching the _Scorpion_ forward. Because the mass of _Scalpel_-class vessels was too great for cold-gas maneuvering thrusters to be used, a (highly toxic) liquid bipropellant consisting of nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine (not to be confused with _drinking_ hydrazine, which is _never,_ **ever,**  **ever** used as a propellant) was used for RCS thrusters instead. This combination was hypergolic, which does not require a separate ignition source, and also provided for a respectable exhaust velocity, just shy of 3.4 kilometers per second.

The _Scorpion_&#39;s bow thrusters activated for about ten seconds, and then the stern thrusters fired (after the bow thrusters stopped firing, of course) to slow the _Scorpion_ relative to the _Scalpel_. Finally, the two ships orbited Relay II side-by-side.

Munwise tapped his wrist communicator. &quot;Munwise to Karina.&quot;

&quot;_Karina here, Captain._&quot;

&quot;Commander. We&#39;ve entered a station-keeping orbit relative to the _Scalpel_. I want you to take a pilot officer, get on the _Cochrane_, and fly over to the _Scalpel_. Their port bow is available for docking; the starboard bow is being occupied by _Shuttle Two_.&quot;

&quot;_Do they not have the standard complement of two convertible shuttles_?&quot;

&quot;They do, but – luckily for you – _Shuttle One_, which would normally occupy the port bow, is berthed to Relay Alpha.&quot;

&quot;_I understand, Captain. I shall depart as soon as I can find a pilot officer. Karina out._&quot;

---

&quot;The shuttle _Cochrane_, registry number KF-02/1, is requesting permission to dock at the port bow, Captain,&quot; Megdia reported, who was currently on conn duty. Dorod had fallen ill, and was temporarily excused from duty for the time being. Since Megdia was the only other officer aboard who had some experience (which was unsurprising, as she was the ship&#39;s astrogator), she was asked to cover for the unfortunate lieutenant while he was receiving treatment in the _Scalpel_&#39;s Sickbay.

&quot;Tell them the Captain sends his regards and they have permission to dock,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;Also, Ensign – contact Commander Enman and have him meet me at the port shuttle airlock.&quot;

&quot;Aye, sir,&quot; Megdia affirmed, and sent her message to the _Cochrane_, on its final approach to the _Scalpel_. It had remained outside the _Scalpel_&#39;s exclusion zone for the time being, as it was not permissible to enter a vessel&#39;s exclusion zone without requesting permission first. She quickly dispatched another message to the ship&#39;s executive officer, ordering him (on Edgun&#39;s authority, anyway) to meet with the captain in the port shuttle airlock. Immediately, both messages were replied to, though not necessarily in words; the _Cochrane_, for instance, blinked its docking node&#39;s lights at the _Scalpel_ for a brief moment – just enough to be detected. Of course, Enman transmitted his reply that he would meet the captain in the port shuttle airlock in two minutes.

&quot;Ensign, I&#39;m headed for the port shuttle airlock. The conn is yours,&quot; Edgun said, before departing through the CIC&#39;s doors.

---

The outer airlock doors opened, after the _Cochrane_ docked and the pressure between the two pressure vessels (the shuttle cabin and the airlock cabin) was equalized, and out stepped Karina and some terrified ensign who had piloted the _Cochrane_ from the _Scorpion_.

&quot;I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s _no need_ for you to be freaking out. You haven&#39;t done anything wrong,&quot; Karina tried to reassure the trembling ensign. He had probably never even met a higher-ranking officer in his _life_, much less a _captain_.

Chief engineer and ensign passed through the inner doors, which slid open. Edgun and Enman were there to meet them.

&quot;Captain, Commander, pleasure to meet you all,&quot; Karina greeted curtly. She still held a grudge against most captains these days, who treated their chief engineers like manure. However, judging by Enman&#39;s posture (who she ascertained to be the chief engineer of the _Scalpel_, by his red-trimmed and grease-spotted jumpsuit), Edgun apparently did not treat his chief engineer _that_ badly.

&quot;Pleasure&#39;s all ours, Commander,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;If you&#39;ll come with me to the briefing room, I&#39;ll give you a more in-detail briefing on this task. I trust Captain Munwise did not reveal too much to you?&quot;

&quot;No, sir,&quot; Karina answered. &quot;He only said we needed to set up a mine and refinery on the surface of Relay II.&quot;

&quot;I shall give you some more information on this endeavor,&quot; Edgun said. &quot;Follow me.&quot;

---

&quot;We&#39;ve been mapping out the surface of Relay II with a scanning satellite, while the _Scorpion_ was _en route_ to Relay II,&quot; Edgun said, pulling up a map on the Briefing Room&#39;s viewscreen. &quot;During its fifty-day scanning period, it discovered some anomalies, namely high concentrations of gaseous methane below the surface.&quot; Edgun tapped another button, displaying the regions of the planet which had a subterranean methane concentration greater than ninety percent.

&quot;As you can see, while the planet doesn&#39;t have a lot of hotspots – regions where the methane concentration is simply ridiculous – these hotspots are _very_ concentrated,&quot; Edgun explained, tapping another button. A marker appeared on the map – _directly above_ one of the hotspots. Edgun continued his speech.

&quot;This marker marks the landing site of the first Kerbin Fleet shuttle – which, incidentally, is where we are planning to construct the Relay colony.&quot;

Karina nodded understandingly. &quot;By placing a methane mine and refinery atop that methane hotspot, the colony can also act as a fuel depot – a way station, if you will, for passing spacecraft.&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;That is exactly our purpose – though we must first establish a mine and refinery. Both our ships&#39; reaction mass supply combined can completely refuel the three shuttles present – _Shuttle Two_, the _Cochrane_, and the _Einstein_ – a maximum of six times. Each shuttle can conduct three surface-to-orbit flights with a full payload complement on a single tank, which means that we have fifty-four opportunities to send the colony supplies down.&quot;

Karina&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;That won&#39;t be enough, sir – preliminary calculations place the number of flights needed to transport the colony&#39;s supplies at eighty-one, and that&#39;s the minimum.&quot;

&quot;Which is _exactly_ why we need to build the mine and refinery first, so that we have as many flights as we need, as opposed to just fifty-four,&quot; Edgun explained.

&quot;Captain, correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the shuttles can only run on liquid hydrogen,&quot; Enman said, confused.

&quot;You are mistaken, Commander,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;The thermal turbojets can run on liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, or even liquid ammonia. It&#39;s not common knowledge, because liquid hydrogen is the most efficient fuel, and also the only one with widespread use.&quot;

&quot;Since liquid methane is less cryogenic and denser than liquid hydrogen, we can also store more of it at a higher temperature, without it boiling off,&quot; Karina added. &quot;The catch is that we lose a bit of exhaust velocity – about two hundred meters per second less compared to liquid hydrogen.&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Edgun said. &quot;So, Commander Karina, care to give me the sitrep? Captain Munwise hasn&#39;t revealed that much to me either.&quot;

&quot;Gladly,&quot; Karina responded. &quot;Commander Enman and I will travel to the designated LZ on the _Cochrane_, along with the piloting officer that brought us here in the first place – unless you prefer that another pilot bring us to the surface.&quot;

Karina continued. &quot;We&#39;ll be on the surface for about three days or so; the _Cochrane_ is equipped with an advanced life-support system, so it can sustain us for that long. We&#39;ll be on rations, however.&quot; She grimaced at the thought, and Enman made a face as well. Eating rations for three days straight was _not_ something the two officers were looking forward to.

&quot;Once we finish setting up the methane mine and refinery, make sure everything&#39;s all right and the plant&#39;s churning out liquid methane, we&#39;ll need _Shuttle Two_ and _Einstein_ to come down to the surface and start ferrying fuel up to the ships,&quot; Karina concluded.

&quot;One more thing, Commander,&quot; Edgun added, and tapped his wrist communicator.

&quot;Edgun to Lieutenant Dorod.&quot;

&quot;_Dorod here, Captain. What&#39;s the occasion_?&quot; asked the lieutenant, who had since recovered from his illness.

&quot;Are you in any shape to fly a shuttle?&quot; Edgun returned.

&quot;_I suppose so, Cap. Doc certified me for duty two hours ago, so it&#39;s your prerogative, sir,_&quot; Dorod replied.

&quot;Excellent. Be at the port shuttle airlock in five minutes. Edgun out.&quot;

--

The _Cochrane_&#39;s hatch opened with a _psshh_, admitting a very impressed Dorod along with the two engineering officers. Dorod was marveling at the upgraded interior of the _Cochrane_, along with many other things; Enman and Karina, on the other hand, were discussing the mission to come.

During the years that the _Scalpel_ was away from drydock, there had been significant technological advances – advances that required a docking facility to undergo a retrofit, which was why the _Scalpel_ had not been modified during its long journey. Take holography, for instance; by the year 2875, a mere five years since the _Scalpel_ left drydock, holographic control panels and displays had become more common on Kerbin Fleet vessels – though some preferred traditional touch control, which was still available, but would eventually be phased out in the years to come. While holography had been in use before that, it was only limited to the projection of still three-dimensional objects, and was not intended to be interacted with.

The holographic control panels were multifunctional; they could suit practically every division of the Kerbin Fleet. A pilot, for instance, could monitor a vessel&#39;s engines, translation drive, and ramscoops; the pilot could interact with the ship&#39;s RCS systems as well, among others. Holographic displays could also be customized; as with their touch-controlled predecessors, the readouts could be displayed in both a quasi-analog form as well as digitally.

Enman and Karina took their seats at the back, preferring to turn their chairs so that they would face and monitor the cargo; Dorod walked up to the pilot&#39;s chair and assumed the helm. As soon as he sat down, the holographic emitters activated, projecting a ring of holographic displays within his cone of vision. The central display was, as usual, the MSD (master systems display); control panels to his left and right concerned command and engine/RCS controls respectively.

Now that there was a relay satellite system about Relay II, allowing intra-system communications, any shuttles departing from either _Scalpel_ or _Scorpion_ had to perform a comm-check first. Using his left hand (albeit awkwardly, since his _right_ was dominant), he tapped on the panel and opened a channel to the _Scalpel_.

&quot;_Cochrane_ to _Scalpel_. Comm check.&quot;

&quot;Scalpel_. Acknowledging comm check. Five by five,_ Cochrane.&quot;

&quot;Copy. Requesting permission for departure.&quot;

&quot;_Granted,_ Cochrane_. Clear horizons._ Scalpel _out._&quot;

Using a multi-touch gesture, Dorod moved the MSD to the left panel, and the command control panel took its place. One tap, and the _Cochrane_ undocked with the _Scalpel_, firing its dorsal thrusters as it went.

Bringing up the navigational subsystem of the command panel, Dorod laid in a course for the colony site; one tap with his right hand kick-started the engines, and the _Cochrane_ sped off into the dawn.
