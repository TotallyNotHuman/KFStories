Sickbay, KFS _Scorpion_ - Five Years Later

The long night had passed, and he felt a stream of heat erupt from his core and spread to the rest of his body. As his senses returned to its _status quo_ – more or less, he saw not a Kerbal&#39;s face, but a screen blinking several lines of text at him. His eyes flashed open, and read the text that the screen was flashing aggressively at him – though with some difficulty, as his vision was still blurred, and his head felt like a primed cold-fusion bomb, ready to go off at any second.

`#75894, you have been released from stasis. You have been held in stasis for 5 years, 130 days, 20 hours, beginning KD 8096.5. Today is KD 08629.0. This is Stasis Pod #75894 standing by.`

Munwise had awakened from stasis.

A head peered into the open stasis pod, which belonged to Donbal; however, the years had put several gray streaks in his hair. He grinned. &quot;Looks like the Captain&#39;s awakening is going smoothly.&quot;

&quot;Uncle?&quot; muttered Munwise.

Donbal frowned. &quot;I take that back.&quot;

One of Munwise&#39;s brain functions kicked in (probably recognition) and Munwise flushed bright green. &quot;Damn! Sorry, Doctor. My bad.&quot;

Donbal put on a smug smile. &quot;Well, it looks like the Captain&#39;s got his vocabulary about him,&quot; he smirked. Then, his smile returned to a genuine one. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Captain. Stasis does some weird things to kerbals. So, how are you feeling?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m feeling better, but I think there are still some things that aren&#39;t thawed out – my brain, for instance,&quot; Munwise answered. Donbal chuckled at this.

&quot;That&#39;s more like you, Captain. You&#39;ve got your sense of humor back,&quot; he said while stifling his laughter. &quot;I suppose I can get you out of that pod, but I can&#39;t certify you for duty just yet.&quot;

&quot;What! Doctor –&quot;

&quot;No whats, Captain. By Regulation 319, Section 7, Paragraph 58, I cannot certify any crew-member for duty within three days of their release from stasis. This is also a Medical Override Clause, which means the authority of the Chief Medical Officer takes precedence over that of the commanding officer&#39;s.&quot; Donbal suddenly looked stern. &quot;I&#39;ll confine you to Sickbay if necessary.&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t be needed, Doctor. You have my word; now, would you kindly get me out of this pod? I&#39;ve been laying here for about the last ten minutes or so, and they&#39;re certainly not built for comfort,&quot; Munwise promised, followed by a plea. Donbal shared a hearty chuckle with his captain, and called for two nurses to help the captain out of the pod.

Munwise shuffled through the hallway, albeit on stiff legs – which was another thing that had not thawed out since his awakening. While his joints were sufficiently unfrozen as to allow his limbs to move about slightly, most of his muscles were still very rigid, which basically rendered his arms and legs slabs of tungsten carbide. It was an unpleasant feeling, but Donbal had assured the captain that these were all normal side effects of a recent release from stasis, and would dissipate in a day or two – coinciding with the regulation&#39;s three-day rule. _Now I know why that is_, mused Munwise silently as he continued to move with some difficulty.

The first thing he decided to do was to visit the CIC. While the ship&#39;s doctor had not yet certified him for duty, he neglected to mention whether he was allowed to set foot there.

The doors slid open, and the officer that resided in his chair was none other than his first officer – evidently, she had been awakened before he had. Karys moved to vacate the captain&#39;s chair, but Munwise held a hand up.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much about it, Commander. Doctor Donbal has not yet certified me for duty, so that chair&#39;s still yours for the time being.&quot;

Karys resumed her seat, and Munwise moved towards the central helm/astrogation console to examine the readouts. The ship was puttering along at two percent of the speed of light in layer 7 space, which made its &#39;true&#39; speed in realspace a not insignificant 2.56 _c_. The ship was still on a course bound for the star itself, but course corrections would be made once the ship crossed the orbit of Relay V, the outermost gas giant – and when Debchel, the conn officer, was certified for duty three days after her awakening.

Munwise walked towards Karys, and gave her an order. &quot;Commander, I know that I&#39;m technically not fit for duty, but I have a task for you. Use our hyperspace communications system, and send an encrypted message to the _Scalpel_. I&#39;m not sure if they have set up a communications relay network around Relay II yet, so continuously broadcast it for ninety minutes. That&#39;s their orbital period, and if they don&#39;t catch that message even once, I don&#39;t know _what_ will.&quot;

Karys nodded, and moved towards one of the multifunctional consoles.

Dorod&#39;s console beeped, indicating a new message. This wasn&#39;t exactly a rare occurrence, considering they had set up an equatorial comm-relay, along with a single polar relay satellite for higher latitudes. While the expeditions they had sent all targeted the equator, the sole polar communications satellite was set up to essentially future-proof the system – though there was still the problem of intra-system communications. _But,_ thought Dorod, who also oversaw the communications array program, _we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it._

He tapped his console once to bring up the message – which, oddly, was in text form. But that was not the only thing that was odd about it; when he opened the message, all he got for his trouble was gibberish.

`%@irp!%y2>6Dt58F?[zu$$42=A6=uCirp!%(:==:2>|F?H:D6[zu$$4@CA:@?u%{i\_gdfh}fr2AE2:?ipDJ@FAC@323=J&lt;?@H[xH2D49@D6?E@4@>>2?5E96$4@CA:@?[2D64@?5\86?6C2E:@?56D:8?E92E:D:?E6?565E@76CCJ4@=@?:DEDE@#6=2Jxx]pD@7D6G6C2=52JD28@WE966I24E52E6x5@?@EC6>6>36C[2DxH2D96=5:?DE2D:DAC:@CE@E9:DX[E96$4@CA:@?92D6?E6C65E96DA96C6@7:?7=F6?46@7E96#6=2JDE2C]%9:D>6DD286:DE@2=6CEJ@FE92E@FC4@=@?:DEDH:==362CC:G:?8D9@CE=J[2?54@?DECF4E:@?@7E964@=@?JD9@F=5AC@4665@?46E96J92G6366?2H2<6?657C@>DE2D:D2?546CE:7:657@C962GJ=23@C3J>JD9:A'Dr9:67|65:42=~77:46C](|`

Gibberish was not, however, the only thing that was in the message. There was also a short one-line message (which was not written in gibberish), detailing the set of keys that could be used to decrypt the message.

`USE KEY-SET: #~%cf (RESTRICTED TO RANK OF CAPT & ABOVE)`

Dorod paged the captain on his intercom. &quot;_Dorod to the Captain. You&#39;d better come down here, sir; there&#39;s something you need to see._&quot;

&quot;There it is,&quot; Dorod reported after Edgun had entered his private decryption key. &quot;Should be coming through any second now.&quot;

Dorod moved away from the console, as the message was for the Captain&#39;s eyes only. Edgun stepped forward, a moment after the message had been decrypted successfully.

KD: 8629.0

Captain:

As you probably know, I was chosen to command the Scorpion, a second-generation design that is intended to ferry colonists to Relay II. As of several days ago (the exact date I do not remember, as I was held in stasis prior to this), the Scorpion has entered the sphere of influence of the Relay star. This message is to alert you that our colonists will be arriving shortly, and construction of the colony should proceed once they have been awakened from stasis and certified for heavy labor by my ship's Chief Medical Officer.

Edgun raised an eyebrow, and turned toward Dorod. &quot;Make sure our communications system is in good shape. I&#39;ll be sending a message from my office,&quot; he ordered. Dorod complied, and did a final systems check on the ship&#39;s communications system.

KD: 8629.3

Captain:

I have received your message, and I welcome you to the Relay system. We have already charted a region of the planet that is suitable for your colonization efforts. Officially, the region has not yet been named, however certain members of my crew have named it after yours truly. Do bear in mind that I do not approve of this naming scheme, but it has stuck among my crew. Also, there is the problem of shuttles and fuel. Our ships carry two convertible shuttles each, and possess sufficient fuel to refuel these shuttles five times. Therefore, the most logical approach to this conundrum would be to establish a mining and refining base on the surface of the planet, once your ship has arrived. In this way, fuel can be supplies in sufficient quantities to support the colonization endeavors.

KD: 8629.7

Captain:

I have acknowledged your prior message. My crew complement has been certified for duty, as it has been far more than three days since their release from stasis. In any case, we have crossed the orbit of Relay V, the outermost gas giant of the Relay system, and shall be diverting course towards the second planet. At our current speed, we shall arrive at Relay II around KD8631.3. As for the problem with the shuttles and fuel, I have notified my chief engineer, and she will be preparing the mining and refining equipment for planetfall. According to her estimates, the mining and refining establishment should be set up within three days of landing.
