# Part I – Countdown

## 1 – Excursion

Low Kerbin Orbit
Year 2870, Common Era

A small, conical pod floated in free-fall around Kerbin. Suddenly, it fired its thrusters, increasing its speed, and the pod flew towards the Orbital Drydock Facility, known more commonly as the Kerbin Spacedock.

The Spacedock was conceived in the earlier part of the century, when the radiobright star known only as 1451-1 R3III 203 had been discovered. Scientists had discovered a massive influx of radio waves that had originated from somewhere out in the interstellar medium. By examining the radio waves&#39; flux density and heading, they ascertained the exact position of the source – which, after a call to the nearest observatory, had confirmed that the radio waves had originated from a star, ten light-years distant.

The notion of radiobright stars had been subject to heated debate over the past century or so. Top minds of the sciences had debated among themselves, but had yet to come up with a logical conclusion why some stars emanated radio waves and others did not. The least they could come up with was that these stars had inhabitable planets, and on those planets were an advanced civilization capable of broadcasting radio waves across the interstellar medium. The civilization also had to amplify the radio waves by using its star, which would have transmitted heinous amounts of radio waves in the first place. To that end, a new spectral class was created for this star: class R, whose connotation was that any star labeled as such transmitted large amounts of radio waves. There were certain flaws with the conclusion; according to the inverse-square law, any radio wave transmitted through the vacuum of space would eventually disperse, the flux density decreasing until the waves faded into quasi-nothingness. Since space was, likewise, not a perfect vacuum, the radio waves would still attenuate, albeit at a snail&#39;s pace; dispersal was still the big problem with interstellar radio waves.

This seemingly absurd conclusion nevertheless kick-started Project _Scalpel_. By that time, the rocket scientists of Kerbin had already mastered usage of the hypersurface, another spatial plane that coexisted with normal space, but was not intertwined with the normal plane of space. Propulsion engineers worked to develop translation drives – as they were termed, since they translated the ship on which it was equipped into various depths of the hypersphere – that could allow the drive to reach layer 7 of the hypersphere, which would allow, with current propulsion technology, to reach a speed 28 percent faster than the speed of light itself.

The translation drive does not necessarily break any laws of relativity – it is simply due to the reduction of relative distance in the hypersphere that allows for faster-than-light travel. One meter in layer 1 is two in normal space; likewise, a speed of one percent of light speed in layer 1 is two percent in normal space. The increase is not linear, but exponential; one meter in layer 2, for instance, is four in normal space. Thus, a speed of 0.01 _c_ in layer 7 is equivalent to 1.28 _c_ in normal space.

In the years following the discovery of 1451-1 R3III 203, the peoples of Kerbin ceased their relatively meaningless quarrels among themselves, and were united as one under a central government. In the year 2840, just five years after the discovery of the radiobright star, the governments of Kerbin were brought together under the &#39;Federation of Kerbin States&#39;. This also led to the development of the Kerbin Fleet, which was under the jurisdiction of the Federation government. It took ten more years to develop and launch the Orbital Drydock Facility, to serve as a shipyard in space, and to ease the eventual construction of KFS _Scalpel_.

The majority of the _Scalpel_ was constructed in space, at the Orbital Drydock Facility. The eager shipyard workers stationed there worked tirelessly for fifteen years, until the _Scalpel_ was finally ready to launch.

Then came the difficult choice of choosing who to put on the _Scalpel_.

The mission planners had estimated – at the very minimum – thirty years for the journey. Twenty years and change for the acceleration and cruise phase, including the return journey, and around ten years to explore the radiobright star itself. They needed a strong crew, and crewkerbs that worked well together – after all, they would be stuck on a cramped starship together for the majority of their lives. Besides, most of the ship was not meant for habitation, and that meant only twenty Kerbals could be aboard the _Scalpel_. There had to be civilians, non-Kerbin Fleet officers, aboard the ship, which only complicated the decision.

The decision was very difficult to make; potential crew rosters were drawn up, the potential crew underwent a psychological test, and a complete medical checkup was conducted on all of the potential crew members. Eventually, the mission planners came to an agreement. Assignment letters were sent out to the selected ones, and – to the mission planners&#39; surprise – not a single one of the selected twenty declined the offer. Of course, the mission planners had anticipated refusals – thirty years away from family was an awfully large request to make of the officers – but none had refused, and so the mission planners quietly vaporized the backup crew rosters.

Two Kerbals sat inside the pod, silently contemplating the vastness of space. Suddenly, the computer beeped.

&quot;_Proximity alert_,&quot; the navigational system said.

The two Kerbals looked up, and the Orbital Drydock Facility grew larger in their cone of view. It was like a giant multi-legged creature, the cage segments providing lighting, airlocks, and berthing for the ship that was inside. Right now, the _Scalpel_ rested in the cradle, connected to the Spacedock with docking clamps. The capsule fired its aft thrusters, to prevent the pod from crashing into the _Scalpel_.

The pod whizzed by the starboard nacelle of the _Scalpel_, upon which was proudly etched her name and registry number: **KFS**  **SCALPEL**  **– FEDERATION OF KERBIN STATES – REGISTRY NUMBER KF-01**.

One of the Kerbals, clad in a yellow-trimmed command jumpsuit, whistled. &quot;_What_ a ship,&quot; he said. That Kerbal happened to be Captain James Edgun, who had been selected to command the _Scalpel_.

&quot;You&#39;re not kidding,&quot; the other Kerbal muttered. He was clad in a red-trimmed operations jumpsuit, and he had one pip fewer than Edgun, who had four. This meant that the Kerbal was ranked commander.

&quot;She&#39;s going to be mine in a few days,&quot; Edgun breathed dreamily.

&quot;Just how fast does she go?&quot; Commander Christopher Enman, the chief operations officer, asked.

&quot;One point two eight _c,_ relative to normal space; it&#39;s actually 0.01 _c_ in layer 7,&quot; Edgun said proudly.

Enman worked it out in his head. He blinked, and worked it out again. _It couldn&#39;t be_, he told himself.

&quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s... Eeloo and back in a bit less than fifteen minutes,&quot; Enman gaped.

&quot;Your brain&#39;s still pretty sharp, my friend, but not sharp enough. It&#39;s twelve minutes, thirty-eight seconds, and five hundred thirty-six point three five milliseconds, not factoring in translation, acceleration, and deceleration,&quot; Edgun recited.

&quot;You know it to the _millisecond_?&quot; Enman was positively flabbergasted.

&quot;First of all, it&#39;s one-hundredth of a millisecond. Second of all, that&#39;s why I&#39;ve got my fourth pip, and you haven&#39;t,&quot; Edgun said jokingly. Enman gave him a playful shove. Before a fight could break out in the cabin, the computer beeped again.

&quot;_Incoming transmission from Fleet Command_,&quot; the computer intoned. The pair ceased their debate, and sat up straight.

&quot;Open a channel,&quot; Edgun directed to the computer. The communications viewscreen came to life, and the face of Admiral Steve Hansy, Commander-In-Chief of the Kerbin Fleet.

&quot;Admiral. It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you,&quot; Edgun said, a slight quaver in his voice.

&quot;Captain. Commander. Likewise,&quot; Hansy replied. &quot;The briefing on the mission of the _Scalpel_ is to be conducted in thirty minutes, and following the briefing will be a banquet – to celebrate the commissioning of the _Scalpel_. The entire crew of the ship is invited to the dinner, along with the top brass.&quot; Edgun&#39;s heart skipped a beat when Hansy uttered those words. &quot;It is now 1700 hours, Fleet Headquarters Standard Time; the briefing is at 1730, and dinner at 1830.&quot;

&quot;Wait. How is the briefing going to be finished in an hour?&quot; Edgun asked.

&quot;Each of your crew members will be handed a data chip, readable by tablet, which contains all essential information and their role-specific information. I trust that reading and processing all that data will take less than an hour,&quot; Hansy explained.

&quot;I see, Admiral. Quite a solution,&quot; Edgun complimented.

&quot;Your compliment is noted. Now, I believe I have not told you about the crew. Aside from the pilot, astrogator, and yourselves, the rest of the crew, mainly those that belong to the engineering and sciences division, are not Kerbin Fleet officers. They have been assigned to us by the Federation Research Initiative, and they have the power to veto your decisions, should a majority vote be conducted. Anyway, a Fleet officer will be placed in charge of each division. One of them will double as your executive officer – Commander Enman here – and the other will do double duty as second officer. In addition to them, we are also assigning a chef to your ship,&quot; Hansy said.

&quot;Why the chef?&quot; Enman inquired.

&quot;Commander, do you not realize that stowing edible provisions for _thirty years_ is rather... inefficient?&quot; Hansy inquired, with just a touch of sarcasm.

&quot;It is. So how -&quot; Enman started, but caught himself. He groaned. &quot;Oh, _no_.&quot;

&quot;Oh, _yes_, Commander. A prototype algae farm and SCWO reactor is included aboard the _Scalpel_, along with a small aeroponics farm. As for emergency provisions, there will be 500 kilograms of water, and a hundred kilograms&#39; worth of ration packs,&quot; Hansy said; the admiral seemed to place his emphasis on the _ration packs_. Both Kerbals in the pod could feel the schadenfreude emanating from the viewscreenitself, though the admiral&#39;s face betrayed no emotions of the kind. &quot;It should last a crew of twenty Kerbals a Münth before they start to get dehydrated or undernourished.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Admiral, sir – if I am not mistaken, the algae farm does not produce citric acid and B vitamins,&quot; Enman said.

&quot;You are indeed correct. Standard 20-milligram multivitamin pills will be included and must be taken daily. To sustain a crew of 20 over 30 years will take less than ten kilograms of multivitamins, so we can pack additional pills. The pills are only accessible to the crew via medication dispensers, installed in their cabin; they are programmed to only dispense one pill per day. Only the Chief Medical Officer can give additional pills to those that need them,&quot; Hansy explained. &quot;As for citric acid, some is included within the multivitamin pill itself, so you needn&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;I see, Admiral. What rank is to be allocated to the civilian crew?&quot; Edgun inquired.

&quot;They have no rank. Though, if you choose to do so, you can afford them enlisted ranks, but do not allocate any rank higher than crewkerb first class; remember to also give out promotions and demotions when applicable. If, of course, the officers go above and beyond the call of duty, you can give them a permanent Kerbin Fleet commission after a discussion with the Chief of Staff,&quot; Hansy replied. &quot;It&#39;s nearing the briefing time, gentlekerbs; I&#39;d hate to hold you up. Hansy out,&quot; the admiral said, before terminating the link.
