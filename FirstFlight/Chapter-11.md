## 11 – _Scorpion_, Take Two

Three Days Later – KD 8096.5

Lieutenant Commander Maya Karina, the _Scorpion_&#39;s chief engineer, walked around in one of the shuttles&#39; cargo bays, examining the latest shipment of colonization equipment. Just the day prior, the &#39;additional cargo&#39; detailed by Admiral Corfrey, the new Commander-in-Chief of the Kerbin Fleet, had arrived on two consecutive ten-ton convertible shuttles. Not only had the two cargo shuttles delivered the necessary colonization equipment, it had also delivered something that the _Scorpion_ had sorely needed: two shuttles.

For some reason, the _Scorpion_ was lacking the two convertible shuttles, capable of transporting cargo and passengers (though not at the same time), that was typical of _Scalpel_-class vessels and their retrofits; the inspection crews had failed to notice that the two convertible shuttles were absent before clearing them for departure.

Fortunately, Admiral Corfrey had ordered the _Scorpion_ to stand down, or the _Scorpion_ would&#39;ve departed drydock without any way to get to and from the surface of Relay II.

The standard cargo shuttles servicing the Kerbin Fleet required rare materials for maintenance, so they would be unsuitable for interstellar voyages. Convertible shuttles, however, were perfect for these long-distance voyages because they could carry cargo or passengers, requiring only the folding of the passenger seats for the shuttle to transport cargo. These convertible shuttles also did not require the rare materials that standard cargo shuttles relied on for maintenance, making that task a much easier ordeal.

Karina picked up one of the helmets that was described in Edgun&#39;s report to Fleet Command (Munwise had forwarded the section pertaining to the helmets, along with the blueprint, to the chief engineer), and couldn&#39;t help but marvel at the Requisitions department&#39;s efficiency. In just two days, they had found a way to overlay the modifications detailed in the blueprint onto EVA suit helmets. The end result was a suit helmet that could collect and purify oxygen from an atmosphere, yet it lacked the rest of the suit, due to its partial-atmosphere working environment.

Karina&#39;s wrist communicator chirped, interrupting her reverie. &quot;_CIC to Karina. This is Captain Munwise; come in, Karina._&quot;

&quot;Yes, Captain. How can I help you?&quot; Karina replied cheerfully, after tapping on her communicator.

&quot;_I just wanted to inform you that Dock Command has cleared us for a departure at 1400 hours,_&quot; Munwise said. &quot;_You&#39;re to start moving the cargo to the cargo bays._&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got three hours to do this, then?&quot; asked Karina.

&quot;_Two, actually. Before we depart, I want you to do a final systems check, and that&#39;ll cost you an hour,_&quot; Munwise replied, somewhat apologetically.

Gritting her teeth, Karina attempted to maintain her cool composure. &quot;Yes, sir. I&#39;ll get right on it. Karina out.&quot;

As soon as the comm-link terminated, Karina uttered a guttural curse in some language she had learned in her Foreign Languages course at the Academy, and called for a team of her fellow engineers. It would be a long two hours.

It had been three hours since Dock Command cleared the _Scorpion_ for their departure at 1400 hours, and things were progressing steadily – the final systems check, completed by the _Scorpion_&#39;s under-appreciated and overworked chief engineer, went through with few problems, and the _Scorpion_ was, at long last, ready for departure.

&quot;Captain on deck,&quot; Karys reported as the CIC doors slid open, and vacated the captain&#39;s chair.

&quot;Thank you, Commander,&quot; Munwise replied respectfully. &quot;Conn, sound departure alert and prepare for departure.&quot;

&quot;Aye, sir,&quot; Debchel answered. She opened a communications channel, and addressed the pickup. &quot;_All hands, this is the CIC. Prepare for departure._&quot;

&quot;Ensign, initiate departure procedure,&quot; Munwise ordered. Debchel complied, and retracted the docking clamps.

One of the differences in this second-generation _Scalpel_-class retrofit, compared to its predecessor, was that the CIC layout was vastly simplified. The bridge consoles (helm and astrogation) from the original _Scalpel_-class were integrated into one console, and the engineering and science consoles were replaced by two multifunctional consoles. These consoles could be configured to display anything, such as vitals monitors for the colonists in stasis. In turn, certain engineering and science functions were transferred to the helm and astrogation consoles.

The conn officer pushed the RCS control forward after retracting docking clamps, and the _Scorpion_ inched out of its cage. Another button, and the translation drive engaged, sending the _Scorpion_ into layer 7 space.

The primary difference between the first-generation _Scalpel_-class and the second-generation retrofit was that the latter was equipped with a stronger hull and &#39;skeleton&#39;, not to mention a more advanced fusion drive. These enhancements, so to speak, allowed the ship to traverse layer 7 of the hypersphere at two percent of _c_ – twice the speed that the original _Scalpel_-class could manage. While this may not seem significant, the apparent velocity relative to realspace is doubled. The stronger skeleton is necessary because as a ship&#39;s speed increases in hyperspace, the spatial fluid&#39;s viscosity is much more of an obstacle; simulations in the propulsion laboratories had ultimately caused the engineers to come to the conclusion that the _Scalpel_-class refit simply had to have a stronger hull, if it were to exploit the power of the class II fusion drive. The original _Scalpel_, if it were equipped with the class II fusion drive, would eventually succumb to the viscosity of the spatial fluid and be dispatched rapidly. Needless to say, the _Scalpel_-class retrofit was shelved until a stronger replacement for the hull could be found.

However, and quite obviously, a replacement was found far quicker than usual; as a result, the _Scorpion_, the first of its retrofit, was christened.

Debchel turned around and looked at her captain – her gaze said all that needed to be said. Munwise nodded, and Debchel refocused on her console. One tap laid in the course to Relay, another primed the fusion reactors with reserve hydrogen, and the final button-push engaged the fusion drive.

As soon as the _Scorpion_ was underway, Munwise issued a ship-wide announcement. &quot;_All personnel, report to Sickbay immediately. Repeat: all personnel, report to Sickbay immediately._&quot;

On the order of Munwise, all personnel had congregated in the ship&#39;s Sickbay. Once everybody aboard (except for the colonists, who slept dreamlessly) had assembled in Sickbay, Munwise started to make an important announcement.

&quot;Now that we&#39;re all here, I have an important announcement to make. To conserve the ship&#39;s supplies, we will all be entering stasis, except for the medical staff, who will remain awake in the case of a contingency. We will be held in stasis until the _Scorpion_ enters the Relay system, at which point we will be awakened; however, Relay II will still be several days out from there. The main reason we&#39;ll be awakened when the _Scorpion_ enters the system is because the AI is insufficiently refined to perform delicate in-system maneuvers. The colonists will still be held in stasis until we&#39;re ready for them to transit to the surface and start building up their colony.&quot;

&quot;What would entering stasis entail?&quot; asked a young engineer.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re basically going to be pumped full of antifreeze and dropped into a vat of liquid nitrogen, except with a hell of a lot more pomp and circumstance,&quot; Munwise said, grinning, which amplified both the wolfish grins and the petrified expressions in the assembled crowd.

&quot;If there isn&#39;t anything else, I&#39;d like to get on with the procedure,&quot; Donbal interrupted. Munwise nodded his assent, and called for the formation of a line – ordered from the lower-ranking officers first, then the higher-ranking officers. The crewkerbs were injected with a combination of antifreeze and a sedative, and then the nurses helped them into a stasis pod, at which point the pod was pumped full of liquid nitrogen. The pod would then be moved into a secure holding space for stasis pods; the vitals of the crewkerbs would be continually monitored, after they were placed in stasis and transferred to the pod storage.

At last, it was Munwise&#39;s turn. Donbal approached the captain with a vial of the antifreeze-sedative mix; he then fitted it onto the syringe, and secured it. The captain looked somewhat uncomfortable when faced with the syringe.

&quot;Feeling apprehensive, Captain?&quot; Donbal asked, genuinely concerned. This would not be the first case of this particular phobia he had handled. Munwise nodded reluctantly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much about it, Cap&#39;n. I&#39;d be nervous if I were in your place,&quot; the doctor said.

&quot;Well, Doc, I suppose I&#39;ll see you in five years,&quot; Munwise grinned. Donbal took this as an &#39;I&#39;m ready&#39; hint and pushed the &#39;needle&#39; part of the jet syringe, which in reality was needleless, into the carotid artery. The sedatives took hold and rendered the captain unconscious, while the two nurses nearby dragged him into a stasis pod. The pneumatic cover moved over his unconscious form, and sealed him in. A push of a button later, liquid nitrogen flowed into the pod, and evaporated into gaseous (albeit extremely cold) nitrogen. The captain&#39;s still form convulsed once, and fell limp – the sedative had _really_ kicked in. Even though he had technically passed on, the cryogenic gas and antifreeze would keep his vital organs functional for as long as was needed.

As Munwise&#39;s consciousness faded in the extreme cold, he found solace in one fact; if he failed to reawaken from stasis, at least he would join his uncle, who had died, among others, traveling on a sleeper-class vessel. The power to the stasis pods had failed during its long journey, and the ship had arrived at port – though with a load of desiccated bodies, as opposed to its load of revivable kerbal popsicles that was its intended cargo. What a mess the lawsuit had been.
