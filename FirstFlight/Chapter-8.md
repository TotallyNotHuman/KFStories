## 8 – The _Scorpion_

Orbital Drydock Facility - 48 Days Later – KD 8093.7

Captain William Munwise, commanding officer of KFS _Scorpion_, strolled down the corridor to his ship&#39;s mess hall. _Things don&#39;t change much, even across retrofits_, he mused silently. The term &#39;mess hall&#39; was also used for the same function on KFS _Scalpel_, the precursor to the _Scorpion_. _But then again, this is only the first retrofit of the_ Scalpel_-class. Things_ can&#39;t _change much with only a generation separating them._

A kerbal walked out of a nearby lift, and joined the captain. That kerbal happened to be Commander Megan Karys, the _Scorpion_&#39;s executive officer. &quot;Good morning, Captain,&quot; Karys greeted respectfully.

&quot;And you, Commander. Care to join me? I&#39;m on my way to the mess to grab a cup of koffee,&quot; Munwise said, returning the greeting.

&quot;What is with the crew of a starship and koffee?&quot; Karys asked rhetorically. &quot;You people practically worship the fifty-liter vats of koffee in the mess.&quot;

&quot;Bah, compared to you, we&#39;re barely even believers of the faith,&quot; Munwise joked. &quot;You drink, what, eight cups of koffee per day?&quot;

&quot;_Six_ cups,&quot; Karys corrected, somewhat defensively. &quot;A first officer&#39;s job is a tiring one.&quot;

&quot;I see, Commander,&quot; Munwise said. Captain and first officer entered the mess hall, and grabbed a clean mug from the racks. Making their way to the large vats, they placed the mugs under the tap, and tapped the button. The electronically-controlled tap opened, filling their mugs with exactly five hundred milliliters of koffee.

&quot;Now that that&#39;s all said and done, let&#39;s get to the CIC,&quot; Munwise said. The two officers resumed their walk to the CIC, holding the mugs of dark, rich elixir.

The doors to the CIC slid open, and Ensign Eileen Debchel, the _Scorpion_&#39;s helmskerb and navigator (whose position was now generalized as &#39;conn&#39;), greeted the captain. &quot;Captain on deck,&quot; she observed.

&quot;Conn, are we ready for departure?&quot; asked Munwise.

&quot;Aye, Captain. Hopefully, once all the colonists are in stasis, we can comm Dock Command. Last I heard, they&#39;re still loading up supplies into the _Scorpion_&#39;s cargo bay, so it may be a while before Dock Command gives the go-ahead,&quot; Debchel reported.

&quot;CIC to Sickbay. Doctor, how&#39;s the procedure going?&quot; Munwise inquired, tapping his chair pickup.

&quot;You _try putting fifty rowdy colonists into stasis!_&quot; an exasperated Doctor/Lieutenant Commander Jack Donbal yelled through the comm. &quot;_About half of them have trypanophobia – that is, fear of needles – so I can&#39;t inject them with the antifreeze-slash-sedative without them going into hysterics. No matter how many times I convince them these syringes are needleless, they&#39;re still freaking out._&quot;

&quot;How much longer, Doc?&quot; Munwise reiterated.

&quot;_Optimistic estimate? About an hour, Cap&#39;n,_&quot; Donbal said, a bit breathless from his rant through the comm system. &quot;Pessimistic _estimate? Could take forever. Sickbay_ out_!_&quot; Following this, he slammed a button on his comm panel, causing the comm systems in the CIC to emit a rather loud noise.

Munwise sighed. Yet _another thing that doesn&#39;t change from generation to generation; grumpy doctors_.

The helm console suddenly started beeping. Debchel turned to her console, then to the captain. &quot;Captain, we have an incoming transmission from Dock Command.&quot;

&quot;Open a channel,&quot; Munwise ordered. Debchel nodded, and tapped a button.

&quot;Scorpion_, you are to stand down from departure readiness_,&quot; Admiral Carson Corfrey, the new C-in-C, said. &quot;_Permission to depart has been denied. There is additional cargo to be delivered to the_ Scorpion_, and that will not be ready for at least three days._&quot;

&quot;What of the colonists?&quot; Munwise demanded. &quot;They are being put into stasis as we speak!&quot;

&quot;_Keep them in stasis and monitor their vitals. What they don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them; in any case, it is only a three-day delay,_&quot; Corfrey explained.

&quot;I understand, Admiral,&quot; Munwise said, resigned to his fate.

&quot;_Captain. Will you join me in your office? There is a private matter I wish to discuss_,&quot; asked Corfrey.

&quot;Very well, Admiral,&quot; replied Munwise. He turned to the conn officer. &quot;Ensign, send the link to my private office; Commander Karys, you have the CIC.&quot;

&quot;Aye, sir,&quot; was the response from both officers. Debchel tapped a few buttons, sending the link to the captain&#39;s office; Karys assumed the captain&#39;s chair as soon as Munwise made his way to his private office.

&quot;_Ah, Captain. We meet again_,&quot; Corfrey said, the moment the doors to the captain&#39;s office shut behind Munwise.

&quot;So, Admiral. Do you want to explain what this three-day delay is all about?&quot; Munwise asked. &quot;You seem very secretive about it.&quot;

&quot;_I did not intend to act secretive on the matter. It is simply a confidential matter, and I could not expose your crew to it_,&quot; Corfrey said. &quot;_I shall start from the beginning._&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m listening, Admiral.&quot;

&quot;_Eighteen days previously, our hyperspace communications array intercepted a hyperspace message from KFS_ Scalpel_. You probably know it well; it is a first-generation design, and the predecessor to the_ Scorpion_. The message contained a detailed report on Relay II, the planet you are to colonize, as well as requisition forms for additional equipment. This equipment is of utmost importance; if we didn&#39;t have it, let&#39;s just say that the colony is going to be off to a bad start._&quot;

&quot;Pray tell, Admiral, what equipment did the message detail?&quot; Munwise asked.

&quot;_Let&#39;s see here,_&quot; Corfrey said, reaching for his tablet and bringing up a document. &quot;_Ah. Oxygen intakes, filters for said oxygen intakes, medication for allergy relief, and a new kind of environmental suit for egresses on Relay II._&quot;

Munwise was about to start again, but Corfrey raised a hand. &quot;_I know what you&#39;re going to say. The importance of certain items may seem ambiguous or confusing. But don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll be forwarding the_ complete _report to you. It&#39;ll provide for some interesting reading, while the requisition forms are being processed and approved._&quot;

This time, Munwise spoke without interruption. &quot;_Three days_ to process and approve requisition forms?&quot; he asked, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;_You&#39;d best not think much about it, Captain. It&#39;s a complicated process_,&quot; Corfrey said, smiling slightly. &quot;_First, the requisition forms have to be approved by the Fleet&#39;s Requisitions department. They have to see if the requested material is available, then decide if the quantity available is sufficient to honor the request._&quot;

The lecture continued. &quot;_If the requisition form is approved, then the department&#39;s head will contact the nearest warehouse with the requested material in sufficient quantity, and then that warehouse will deliver the material to its destination._&quot;

Munwise sighed. &quot;I had no idea that the process was so complicated, Admiral.&quot;

&quot;_Worry not, Mr. Munwise_,&quot; the admiral replied, flashing a toothy smile. &quot;_The first step is quite easy; all these requisition forms have my blessing, so to speak – this means that the Requisitions department will automatically approve the forms and honor the requests._&quot;

&quot;And it will still take three days?&quot; Munwise asked, less suspiciously now that he knew more of the inner workings.

&quot;_Not necessarily. Could be one day, could be two. It all depends on how quickly Requisitions can build the suit itself, how quickly it can get the requisitioned items to the Kerbin Fleet shuttle port, and if there&#39;s an available cargo shuttle_,&quot; Corfrey explained.

&quot;Very well, Admiral. And in one or two days, we will have the go-ahead to depart?&quot;

&quot;_That is what I&#39;m hoping for,_&quot; said Corfrey. &quot;_Well, Captain… I&#39;ll leave you to your report-reading. Check your inbox; I have forwarded it to you already. Corfrey out._&quot;

The comm link closed, leaving Munwise alone in his office. His terminal chimed, signifying an incoming message.

&quot;Computer, does the unread message have attachments?&quot; Munwise asked.

&quot;_Affirmative. Message number 4633 contains one attachment, titled_ The Relay Star System: A Detailed Report_,_&quot; the computer replied.

&quot;Download attachment from message 4633 to tablet.&quot;

The computer beeped in the affirmative, and the tablet started to beep. Just as suddenly as it started, it stopped and beeped, signifying that the attachment was now stored on the tablet&#39;s internal storage.

Munwise picked up the tablet, and proceeded to read it. _The admiral was right_, he mused. _This_ does _make for some interesting reading._
