## 7 – A Colony

Surface of Relay II - 196 Days Later – KD 8081.5

The shuttle&#39;s hatch opened with a _psshh_, and the members of the first expedition to Relay II stepped out.

Further contact with Alpha had revealed the presence of two terrestrial planets orbiting the Relay star, which was the name the creators of the station had bestowed upon the star, for reasons unknown. Some speculated that the star was retroactively named &#39;Relay&#39; because of the radio beacon, which acted as a relay (hence its namesake), but Alpha declined to comment on the matter. Furthermore, Alpha indicated that the inner planet orbited its primary with a somewhat high orbital eccentricity; its apoapsis was inside the star&#39;s circumstellar habitable zone, but its periapsis was too close to the star, making it unsuitable for colonization. The second planet, however, was another story; it resided almost exactly between the habitable zone&#39;s inner and outer boundaries, making Relay II perfect for a budding colony.

Alpha had calculated a constant-thrust trajectory for the _Scalpel_ to use; this data was fed into the _Scalpel_&#39;s navigational computers, and six days later, it departed for Relay II, carrying the _Scalpel_&#39;s senior staff and scientists who had volunteered to leave Relay Alpha and get a first-hand look at Relay&#39;s second terrestrial planet.

Just 190 days after the _Scalpel_ departed from a station-keeping orbit about Relay Alpha, it entered Relay II&#39;s sphere of influence, and was blazing along at a not insignificant speed. Fortunately, the translation drive was still online, or else the crew of the _Scalpel_ would be doomed to become part of a crater on Relay II, if there was a crater at all; while Alpha had indicated that the pressure at sea level was not a full atmosphere, it was quite substantial.

When the _Scalpel_ closed in on the planet, the translation drive engaged, and the viscous spatial fluid helped decelerate the _Scalpel_ into low orbit of Relay II. Shortly after fluid braking, the _Scalpel_ reemerged in realspace, and the members of the first expedition prepared to go planetside, via a shuttle that had been retrieved from Relay Alpha prior to embarking on this journey.

&quot;_Shuttle Two_ to _Scalpel_.&quot;

&quot;Scalpel _here,_ Shuttle Two. _You&#39;re the first ones to land here. How do you feel?_&quot;

&quot;We couldn&#39;t have done it without you, Captain. In fact, the shuttle crew has unanimously decided to name this landing zone _Edgun&#39;s Landing_.&quot;

&quot;_I&#39;m honored. Of course, Kerbin Fleet protocol mandates that the colony must be named according to the star system&#39;s name. Therefore, the colony would be named_ Relay Colony_._&quot;

&quot;Of course, Captain. That is agreeable, but this landing zone, where the first Kerbin Fleet shuttle landed on Relay II, will be named as previously discussed.&quot;

&quot;_Very well. So, does the neighborhood seem habitable?_&quot;

&quot;At first glance, yes, Captain. There are no indigenous fauna on this planet, and the local flora do not seem to be harmful to our physiology. However, some of us do seem to be allergic to the pollen emanated by certain flowers, but I think that can be alleviated with certain medications, and for long-term solutions, an air purifier.&quot;

&quot;_Excellent. Prepare to return to the_ Scalpel_, and we&#39;ll discuss this further. Over and out._&quot;

&quot;Now that everyone&#39;s here, I&#39;ll explain why I called this meeting. Fleet Command is expecting a very detailed and lengthy report from yours truly; I&#39;m talking three pages, maybe fifteen hundred words, so I&#39;m going to need all the information I can get out of you guys.&quot;

It had been an hour since the expedition returned from the surface of Relay II. Now, Edgun had called a meeting in the ship&#39;s Briefing Room, and mandated that all crew members present and accounted for to attend the meeting.

&quot;Let&#39;s start with you. Commander, what does the Engineering team have to say?&quot; Edgun asked, addressing Commander Enman, who headed the Engineering part of the expedition.

Enman cleared his throat. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve been working on this helmet of sorts; it&#39;s similar to an environmental suit, but minus the suit. I call it the Partial-Atmosphere Excursion Helmet, or PAEH; it&#39;s just pronounced &#39;pay&#39;, because the H is silent.&quot;

He called to the computer present in the briefing room. &quot;Computer, begin holographic program _PAEH Simulation_.&quot;

The computer beeped in the affirmative, and a holographic model of the helmet, attached to a standard Kerbin Fleet jumpsuit, materialized.

&quot;The helmet actually stands alone; however, the standard jumpsuit is still required. Gloves and boots are worn with the helmet/jumpsuit combo to protect the extremities. The suit can theoretically sustain the user indefinitely, given a sufficiently oxygenated atmosphere, and a sufficient water supply. Speaking of that, the suit can hold an hour&#39;s worth of water, and an hour&#39;s supply of reserve oxygen. Here&#39;s the thing; you&#39;re breathing the oxygen that it takes in and filters, and the reserve oxygen tank doesn&#39;t kick in unless the suit&#39;s intakes stop functioning. There are only a couple of ways this can happen; if the intake filters are clogged up, maybe, or if the CO₂
 vents act up. If the vents stop working, it has to expel the CO₂ _somehow_, or the user will die of carbon dioxide poisoning. So the oxygen intakes are deactivated, the reserve tank&#39;s activated, and the oxygen intake is converted into a vent,&quot; Enman explained.

&quot;Fascinating. And this can be modified from a standard Kerbin Fleet environmental suit helmet?&quot; one of the engineers asked.

&quot;That&#39;s the idea; you only need to fit two vents-slash-intakes, make some changes to the circuitry, and you have it,&quot; Enman replied proudly.

&quot;Commander, would you contribute to my report to Fleet Command? I think they&#39;ll be fascinated by it,&quot; Edgun asked. &quot;Might even earn you that promotion to captain you really want,&quot; he joked.

&quot;I already have composed a report on the matter,&quot; Enman said, deadpan despite Edgun&#39;s jesting. &quot;I&#39;ll have it forwarded to you as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;Very well, Commander. I shall see to it that your report is included in my formal report to Fleet Command,&quot; Edgun promised. He then addressed the computer. &quot;Computer, end all holographic programs.&quot;

The helmet and jumpsuit dematerialized, and Edgun continued. &quot;Commander Katbeth, what does the Science team have to say?&quot;

&quot;The planet orbits its primary every 120 days. Its day is 33 Kerbin hours long, making the year about two-fifths as long as the Kerbin year. Surface gravity and atmospheric depth is point six atmospheres, and its atmosphere is slightly oxygen-rich. This makes the true oxygen concentration 18 percent, which is slightly lower than Kerbin standard. As we said during the comm link, there are no indigenous fauna, and the local flora consist of grasses, herbs, and flowers. However, certain flowers secrete pollen that are incompatible with our physiology, so we&#39;ll need to filter any air intakes and provide medication for allergy relief,&quot; Katbeth reported. &quot;The Relay star system possesses five planets; three gas planets, and two terrestrial planets. We think that Relay II is most suited for colonization; while Relay I is also a terrestrial planet, its periapsis, which is the lowest point in its orbit, lies outside the circumstellar habitable zone. The other three planets are gas giants, and their situation is unique, to say the least. On our inbound trajectory, our radiation sensors detected a sharp rise in radiation when we crossed the orbit of the then-unknown Relay V. The radiation peaked at around the orbit of Relay IV, and diminished from there. Radiation returned to safe levels after we crossed the orbit of Relay III, but any future inhabitants of Relay II will still receive an annual radiation dose just a bit higher than Kerbin sea level.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the maximum amount of radiation our sensors recorded on our inbound trajectory?&quot; asked Edgun.

&quot;I can&#39;t tell for sure, what with the hyperspace sensors not being accurate and all that, but I can ascertain that the maximum amount recorded was ten Sieverts per year,&quot; Katbeth reported.

&quot;Thank you, Commander,&quot; Edgun said. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to include that in my report.&quot; Then, he addressed the crowd. &quot;Do any of you have anything to add?&quot;

&quot;What about jurisdiction of the colony and star system?&quot; a scientist asked.

&quot;That&#39;s a good question,&quot; Edgun replied, nodding approvingly. &quot;Fleet Command has been debating the issue, and they&#39;re still undecided. Most of the admirals, however, are of the opinion that the colony should retain partial sovereignty. Personally, I am also a proponent of that idea, and I will include that in my report.&quot;

Edgun was about to conclude the meeting, when an idea popped into his mind. Grinning, he asked, &quot;Do any of you have camping experience?&quot;

---

The crew members, three in total, assembled in one of the cargo bays. The captain was there as well, though he would not accompany them on this short-term expedition. In the background were inflatable habitat modules, though colloquially known as tents, due to their resemblance to the piece of camping equipment.

&quot;These are standard-issue inflatable habitat modules. Each module holds three, and – for this purpose – filtered oxygen intakes have been fitted. A basic comm antenna will be available; however, we haven&#39;t established a radio relay system, so line-of-sight will be required to establish contact. The three of you, along with this module and the odds-and-ends, will be sent down on a shuttle; the shuttle, however, will lift off and rendezvous with this ship as soon as you are set up,&quot; explained Edgun. &quot;Along with the habitat module, I will also send down three days&#39; worth of water and food. That, I shall prepare for later. Any questions?&quot;

&quot;Ah, Captain! What can I do for you?&quot; Lenory, jovial as ever, greeted the captain as he stepped into the mess hall.

&quot;Let&#39;s see, Mr. Lenory. I will need your permission to retrieve nine kerbal-days&#39; worth of water and standard rations, from the Storm Cellar,&quot; Edgun said.

&quot;What&#39;s the occasion, Captain?&quot; asked Lenory, curious. &quot;I haven&#39;t had the chance to catch up on ship-gossip.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not exactly gossip, so I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;I&#39;ll be sending an expedition down to the surface – this time, they will stay for three days in an inflatable habitat module.&quot;

&quot;I see. Well, you have permission; I just need to cook up nine kerbal-days&#39; worth of food, to replace the rations you&#39;re retrieving from the Storm Cellar,&quot; Lenory affirmed. &quot;I shall have the food delivered to the Storm Cellar once I have prepared them. As for the rations, I&#39;ll have them delivered to _Shuttle Two_ as soon as possible.&quot;

Edgun thanked the ship&#39;s cook, who replied with an &quot;Anything for you, _Mon Capitan_&quot; and a genuine smile, and left the mess hall.
