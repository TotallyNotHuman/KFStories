## 10 – Expedition

_Shuttle Two_ - Several Days Later – KD 8095.7

A few hours prior, the inflatable storage module and the nine kerbal-days&#39; worth of supplies were loaded onto the shuttle; once the three intrepid &#39;campers&#39; and the pilot were aboard _Shuttle Two_, the shuttle could bid the _Scalpel_ farewell, and it could make for the landing site known unofficially as _Edgun&#39;s Landing_.

The captain had neglected to mention the name of the landing site that his fellow crew members had named after him, in his report sent to Fleet Command; knowing, undoubtedly, that the very mention of having a landing site named after oneself would raise more than a few eyebrows in the Admiralty. Besides, he _himself_ did not approve of this naming scheme either, though he did not disclose this to the crew.

The comm sounded with a &quot;Shuttle Two _to CIC_&quot;, and Edgun tapped the panel on his chair.

&quot;CIC here, _Shuttle Two_.&quot;

&quot;_Good to see you again, Captain. Just letting you know we&#39;re ready for undocking,_&quot; Dorod, the shuttle pilot in question, reported.

&quot;Everyone and everything is aboard, Lieutenant?&quot; asked Edgun.

&quot;_Aye, sir._&quot;

&quot;Very well. You have permission to undock. Have a safe trip, Lieutenant, and one other thing; when can I expect the shuttle to be back?&quot;

&quot;_I&#39;ll probably be back within the hour, depending on launch windows and intercepts._&quot;

&quot;Clear horizons, Lieutenant. CIC out,&quot; Edgun concluded, and terminated the link. Moments later, the sensor arrays indicated that _Shuttle Two_ had undocked from the _Scalpel_, reoriented itself so its tail faced the direction of travel, and a red-hot plume of liquid hydrogen exuded from the shuttle&#39;s engines.

Meanwhile, aboard the shuttle, the three &#39;campers&#39; were preparing for planetfall. The captain had graciously allowed each of the campers to bring with them some personal effects; while he did not expressly limit what could or could not be carried planetside, the captain had muttered, &quot;For the _Kraken_&#39;s sake, try to cut down on it.&quot; Naturally, the campers used their common sense and limited their personal effects.

---

&quot;Well, if you&#39;re all set up, then I&#39;ll leave you to your camping.&quot;

It had been fifteen minutes since the shuttle touched down at _Edgun&#39;s Landing_, and the crew had set up the inflatable habitat quite rapidly. While the habitat was fitted with compressed oxygen &#39;cartridges&#39; to facilitate rapid inflation (but not deflation, interestingly enough), there was still the problem of transporting the rations into the inflated habitat, not to mention the personal effects.

&quot;We&#39;re quite ready now, Lieutenant,&quot; one of the campers called out. &quot;Have a safe trip back to the ship.&quot;

Dorod nodded, and closed the shuttle&#39;s hatch. A moment later, the dorsal thrusters flared to life, scorching the grass below it. Below him, the campers waved goodbye at him, a sentimental gesture that he would reciprocate – _if_ he wasn&#39;t concentrating on flying a multi-ton surface-to-orbit shuttle with wings inside an atmosphere.

_I wonder why they didn&#39;t pave this LZ yet,_ Dorod mused. _We&#39;ve already had this shuttle take off_ twice _from here, and the grass marking the landing zone will just eventually become…fine powdered_ carbon_, scorched to a crisp._ Most _appetizing._

_Also, shuttles from the_ Scorpion _carrying the colonists will also have to land here. There&#39;ll be a lot of colonists, and a lot of shuttles for them to transit to the surface and land here, not to mention the_ supplies _and shore-sick officers._

_Their piloting skills are not as good as yours,_ Lieutenant _Matthew Dorod,_ Salutatorian _of the Class of 2867. They don&#39;t know when to stop firing their thrusters, when to engage the intakes, and how long the engine needs to spool up._

He tucked the thoughts somewhere in his brain, and concentrated on flying the shuttle. Now that the shuttle had ascended to a safe altitude on thruster power, he tapped a button on his control panel to allow the engines to spool up, and to open the intakes. Since he was operating in an atmosphere, the shuttle&#39;s liquid hydrogen supply could be conserved by running the shuttle&#39;s intakes.

The shuttle was designed for both surface-to-orbit and orbit-to-orbit transit modes, and it would encounter a planet with gravity and atmosphere not dissimilar to that of Kerbin&#39;s sooner or later. The shuttle, however, could lift a payload of ten tons from Kerbin&#39;s surface into Kerbin orbit, given a full load of reaction mass (the liquid hydrogen) and fuel (the fissile material in the engine&#39;s reactors), so Relay II would be no problem.

For surface-to-orbit transit on a terrestrial world, the intakes would be opened to collect hydrogen from the atmosphere – if there were any present in to begin with. This gaseous hydrogen would be redirected to the compressors, and then passed through a heat exchanger. The heated, compressed hydrogen then drives a turbojet. Since the hydrogen does not come into direct contact with the fissile material itself, only the heat exchangers, the resultant exhaust is not radioactive at all. Once the intakes run out of hydrogen to collect, the engine&#39;s rocket mode would be activated, which uses the liquid hydrogen stores onboard to achieve thrust. In this case, the turbojet is bypassed, and the liquid hydrogen stores are passed through the heat exchanger directly. This configuration does not require liquid oxygen, which act as oxidizers in rocket engines, to be stored onboard.

The engine completed its spooling process, and _Shuttle Two_ sped off into the dawn, heading towards a rendezvous with its mothership, the _Scalpel_.

It had been an hour since _Shuttle Two_ had returned from its &#39;delivery&#39; mission, and the _Scalpel_ was coming into line-of-sight of the habitat module&#39;s comm antenna.

&quot;Lieutenant, are you able to establish contact with the landing party?&quot; asked Edgun.

&quot;Just a few moments more, sir,&quot; Dorod replied. &quot;We&#39;re coming into range any second now.&quot;

As he said this, a red light on his console turned green, and Dorod began to initiate the connection.

&quot;Alright, Captain. I&#39;ve got them. We will remain in communications range for approximately three minutes; after this, they&#39;ll be incommunicado until we come &#39;round next orbit,&quot; Dorod reported. &quot;Since the antenna installed is a basic short-range low-bandwidth antenna, we only have audio and low-density data capability, if they have any to transfer.&quot;

Edgun nodded his understanding, and the comm crackled to life. &quot;_Landing Party to_ Scalpel_. Come in,_ Scalpel.&quot;

&quot;We read you, Landing Party. How&#39;s it going down there?&quot; asked Edgun.

&quot;_Everything&#39;s fine, Captain, thank you very much,_&quot; Orburry, the xenobiologist and quasi-commander of the expedition, replied. &quot;_Though, I would like to file a complaint._&quot;

&quot;Which would be?&quot; Edgun inquired, the slightest hint of a smile tugging at his face.

&quot;_The rations are blander than Temporal Mechanics,_&quot; Orburry joked, which elicited a laugh from the CIC crew on duty. Edgun smiled, and continued.

&quot;I will take note of that complaint, Mr. Orburry. In the meantime, how about a sitrep?&quot;

&quot;_Of course, Captain. We&#39;ve collected some geological and floral samples from the neighborhood, and Crewkerbs Shepberry and Haynie are conducting a wide variety of tests on these samples. Hopefully, we&#39;ll have these test results uploaded to the_ Scalpel_&#39;s computers on the next orbit,_&quot; Orburry reported.

Edgun was about to speak again, when Dorod interrupted him.

&quot;Sorry to bother you, Captain, but we&#39;re moving out of comm range of the habitat module. You&#39;ve thirty seconds before the link&#39;s terminated.&quot;

&quot;I understand, Lieutenant,&quot; Edgun replied. &quot;Crewkerb Orburry, it appears I will have to sign off now. Hopefully, by the next orbit, you&#39;ll have the test results.&quot;

&quot;_I&#39;m certain that the test results will be ready. The_ Scalpel_&#39;s orbital period is, what, ninety minutes?_&quot;

&quot;That it is, Crewkerb. This is _Scalpel_ signing off.&quot;

A few seconds later, the communications link was severed, and Dorod&#39;s console reflected that by blinking a red light. A tap on his console shut off said light, and then it was time to wait.

Night gradually fell on Relay II, and the members of the expedition were preparing for their sleep cycle. They were more exhausted than usual, because a day on Relay II lasted for 33 hours; in turn, the work cycles and sleep cycles were six and three hours (respectively) longer than on Kerbin and aboard the _Scalpel_. The extra three hours of sleep, however, would more than make up for the six additional hours the crewkerbs had to stay awake.

As the two other campers gradually changed out of their standard Kerbin Fleet jumpsuits and into their sleepwear, however, Orburry was working away at his tablet, which he had brought down from the _Scalpel_.

&quot;Al, what&#39;re you doing? It is _way_ past the beginning of sleep-cycle,&quot; Shepberry inquired, concerned about his fellow crew member.

&quot;Hmm? Oh, don&#39;t mind me, Dean. I&#39;m just cataloging reports and test results,&quot; Orburry replied, after snapping out of his stupor.

&quot;Cataloging reports and test results –? Al, what is going on with you?&quot; Shepberry asked, obviously confused.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; asked Orburry, oblivious to the fact that it was late at night.

&quot;In case you _completely forgot_ what I just said about _fifteen seconds_ ago, it is _thirty minutes_ past the beginning of sleep-cycle,&quot; Shepberry said, trying to keep his exasperation in check. &quot;Unlike you, Al, we _actually_ want to get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;Right. I&#39;ll just finish cataloging this report, and head to bed. Happy, _Dad_?&quot; Orburry said, with a slight tinge of annoyance from being interrupted.
