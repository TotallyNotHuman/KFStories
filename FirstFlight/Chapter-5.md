## 5 â€“ Departure

Briefing Room, KFS _Scalpel_ - 1530 hours, FHST

&quot;All hands, attention to orders.&quot;

The crowd immediately ceased their small talk, and stopped any movements. Hansy, the speaker that uttered the order, continued to read from the tablet.

&quot;From Fleet Headquarters, Office of the Admiralty to Captain James Edgun. As of this date, you are requested and required to take command of KFS _Scalpel_. Signed, Admiral Steve Hansy, KD 7032.3.&quot;

Hansy then addressed the computer. &quot;Computer, transfer command codes to Captain James Edgun.&quot;

The computer replied in the affirmative. &quot;_Command codes transferred._&quot;

Edgun approached Hansy, and brought his right hand up to his temple. &quot;I relieve you, sir.&quot;

Hansy returned the salute. &quot;I stand relieved.&quot; Both of them lowered their hands, and brought it forward to shake the other&#39;s hand.

&quot;Thank you, Admiral,&quot; Edgun said.

&quot;Congratulations, Captain,&quot; Hansy said. &quot;Good luck out there, and Kraken-speed.&quot;

Hansy left the briefing room, and located the airlock currently connected to the spacedock&#39;s docking hub. Once Hansy disembarked from the ship, Edgun turned to his crew. He was holding a box; inside the box were rank devices for the civilian crew, in the form of patches as opposed to pips for the commissioned Fleet officers.

&quot;Civilian crew members, you will be granted an enlisted rank from this day forth. You will no longer be addressed as &#39;civilian&#39;, but with your rank, or the title &#39;noncom&#39;, which is short for &#39;non-commissioned officer&#39;. Your initial rank is Crewkerb third class, the lowest enlisted rank. Receive commendations, and you will be promoted; be reprimanded, and you will be stripped of your rank or demoted,&quot; Edgun explained. He held the box out. &quot;Now, you may each take a rank device. Remember to wear this on your right chest, along with your Kerbin Fleet-assigned jumpsuit, when you are on duty.&quot;

The civilians made a single file line, collecting from Edgun their rank devices. The patches bore the Kerbin Fleet insignia, along with a single slash protruding from the insignia; the number of slashes extending from the insignia inversely corresponded to the class of crewkerb. The civilian crew stashed the patches in their pockets, as none of them were in uniform. Once the patches were distributed to the civilians, Edgun spoke again.

&quot;All Kerbin Fleet officers, report to the Central Information Center. I&#39;ll be there in a second. Noncoms, come to the CIC if you wish to do so, but you are not required to,&quot; he said. The four other officers rose, and headed for the CIC.

Edgun grinned. It was time to make history.

&quot;Captain on deck.&quot;

&quot;All stations, report,&quot; Edgun commanded.

&quot;Helm is standing by, Captain. RCS manifolds purged, and tank pressure is nominal. Throttle controls and avionics are functioning within parameters,&quot; Dorod reported.

&quot;Astrogation systems report ready, sir. Stellar Cartography has sent us the latest star charts; we have data and relative positions for all stars within 20 light-years of Kerbol,&quot; Megdia announced.

&quot;Engineering systems are looking good, Cap&#39;n. All ramscoops are functioning within parameters. Translation drives are nominal; fusion and fission systems at standby,&quot; Enman detailed.

&quot;Science systems are nominal, sir. Sensor array is at standby; volatile laboratory samples are secured,&quot; Katbeth said.

&quot;Lieutenant Dorod, open a channel to Dock Command,&quot; Edgun ordered.

&quot;Channel open, sir,&quot; Dorod replied, after tapping a few buttons at the helmskerb&#39;s console.

&quot;This is Captain James Edgun of KFS _Scalpel_. Requesting permission to depart drydock,&quot; he intoned.

&quot;_Permission granted, KFS_ Scalpel_. Good luck, and Kraken-speed_,&quot; the officer stationed at Dock Command replied through the com, and the link was severed.

&quot;Helm, disengage docking clamps,&quot; Edgun commanded. Dorod tapped a few buttons, and loud _clanks_ reverberated throughout the CIC.

&quot;All clamps released. Awaiting further commands, sir,&quot; Dorod replied.

&quot;Take her out, Mr. Dorod. Straight and steady,&quot; Edgun said. Dorod pushed forward on the fore/aft RCS control slider, and the _Scalpel_ inched out of the Spacedock. After a few seconds, the helmskerb turned around, and spoke again.

&quot;We&#39;ve cleared drydock, sir. Ready for superluminal flight,&quot; Dorod reported.

&quot;Mr. Enman, how&#39;re we looking?&quot; Edgun asked.

&quot;Fusion systems are at standby, and hydrogen storage is fully populated. Translation drives are good, as well. I&#39;d say we&#39;re ready,&quot; Enman remarked coolly.

&quot;Very well. Initiate translation on my mark, Commander,&quot; Edgun commanded. &quot;Layer 7.&quot;

&quot;_All hands, this is the CIC. Brace for immediate translation,_&quot; Enman said to the comm-link from his console. With the announcement broadcast, he returned to his console, and started to work.

&quot;Shield generators charging,&quot; Enman reported, working furiously at his console. &quot;Inertial coupling field is active. Translation in five...four...three...two...one...&quot;

From an observer near the _Scalpel_, it would seem that the ship had suddenly disappeared, after releasing a brilliant flash of light. The _Scalpel_, in reality, tumbled through several layers of the hypersphere, before coming to a stop at the 7th layer.

&quot;Astrogator, lay in a course for 1451-1,&quot; Edgun ordered.

&quot;Course laid in, sir,&quot; Megdia replied.

Dorod&#39;s nimble fingers flew across his console as soon as the course parameters were transmitted to his console. &quot;Bearing one-three-nil, mark oh-four-three,&quot; Dorod said to himself. The _Scalpel_ fired her thrusters, reorienting herself to the coordinates provided.

Turning around, the lieutenant made his final report before the _Scalpel_ departed. &quot;We are on course, sir.&quot;

&quot;Engage.&quot;
