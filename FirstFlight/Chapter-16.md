## 16 – Relay&#39;s Secret

Mount Explorer, Relay II - Two Years Later – KD 8784.0

The two captains – Edgun and Munwise – overlooked Relay Colony from their vantage point, Mount Explorer – one of the peaks near the colony site. In just two years, it had grown from a small methane mining base to a full-fledged colony, populated by the fifty colonists that the _Scorpion_ had carried from Kerbin. The colony was small, but it had everything the colonists needed; habitat modules, agriculture modules, not to mention the liquid methane that had become its major export. Well, export was a misnomer; liquid methane was still provided free of charge to members of the Kerbin Fleet, but any other passing vessel would be subject to landing and refueling fees

Munwise noted that the the other captain was carrying a slab of iron and a welder-cutter – he couldn&#39;t help but wonder why he would need these things; in this highly advanced information age, one could record things far more efficiently than &#39;chiseling&#39; a slab of iron. So he asked…

&quot;Captain, might I ask why you are carrying a slab of iron and that welder-cutter?&quot;

Edgun didn&#39;t reply – not in words. He withdrew his electronic tablet, and showed Munwise a sketch from his tablet&#39;s storage.

&quot;I thought I might memorialize the founding of Relay Colony by crafting a plaque,&quot; Edgun explained. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I found that quote oddly satisfying,&quot; Munwise said, once he noticed the quote from The Aeneid. &quot;I&#39;ve always been a sucker for classical literature.&quot;

&quot;So have I, Captain,&quot; Edgun said, smiling. &quot;So have I.&quot;

Another thought popped into Edgun&#39;s head. &quot;Your mission is technically complete, Captain,&quot; he added. &quot;You&#39;re free to depart.&quot;

Munwise shook his head. &quot;No, sir. I stay here until the _Scalpel_ is to depart, and actually, I have a request to make.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead.&quot;

&quot;Your crew – and yourself, of course, if you wish to – can enter stasis for the long journey back. I&#39;ll be transferring twenty additional pods, along with some medical staff familiar with this technology, to your ship,&quot; Munwise offered. &quot;As a sign of respect, the _Scorpion_ will coast at half engine power on the return journey, and – if it&#39;s possible, of course, our two ships can cruise in formation.&quot;

&quot;I think that arrangement is perfect,&quot; Edgun said. &quot;In the meantime, however, my crew and I will have to return to Relay Alpha. The station – and some personnel who have remained aboard – awaits us.&quot;

---

The _Scalpel_ came to a stop as it approached the gargantuan station, hanging in space less than an AU from its parent star. Sensing the _Scalpel_&#39;s presence, Alpha blinked one of the lights in the station&#39;s many berths as a sign of welcome. The crew donned their excursion suits and jetpacks, and jetted over to one of the station&#39;s airlocks. One pressurization later, the crew – Edgun among them – had set foot on the station once again.

One of the scientists welcomed Edgun, though she sported a serious mien. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you again, Captain. We all are. Alpha has just revealed its final module, and I think you&#39;d find it interesting.&quot;

Before the scientist said anything more, Alpha responded.

```

Yes. It is true. As of several moments ago, I have divulged my final module to your crew. It is the communications module, and it is how I had managed to eavesdrop, if you will, on your primitively faint radio waves. It also verifies your postulation that an advanced civilization had broadcast those radio waves. There are thousands upon thousands of these civilizations out in the deep black, some benevolent, some malevolent.

I was constructed by a race known as the Procyons, a race – if you will not be offended – that is far more advanced than yours. Approximately eight centuries ago, they voyaged to this system and established this station housing my consciousness, in the hopes that a benevolent civilization would encounter it, learn from my memory banks, and eventually make contact and ally with them.

Now, my internal subroutines have deemed you fit; you seem to fulfill all of the characteristics that my creators described. Eagerness to learn, for example; peacefulness, but not submissiveness. I shall now allow you to compose and send a message to them. Along with your message, I will also send all the data I have collected on you all, so that my creators can understand your race more fully.

```

Edgun picked up his tablet, and started to compose a message.

```

We extend our best wishes to you, inhabitants of another world.

*After examining the data that your artificial intelligence has sent to you, you should have a basic understanding of kerbal society, as well as our history and language. As a result of our efforts, as well as the efforts of those who came before us, we have built for us a splendid civilization. And now, we have reached up and touched the stars.

We may be a peaceful race, but the universe is not a friendly place. I am certain that hate exists in the universe, as does prejudice and war. I speak of this because I know from experience; before our planet was united as one, we quarreled amongst each other over pointless things. Land, perhaps, or maybe water. But we took the first step – solving our conflicts and embracing each others' differences.

With the best of intentions, we look forward to the day we finally make contact. In this vast universe, full of species and civilizations both benevolent and malevolent, allies are the closest thing to a kind, caring parent. The universe is grand, but life is far grander. We are destined to meet; perhaps not in our lifetimes, but possibly in the next.

```

Alpha asked the captain if he was ready to send the message, who replied in the affirmative, and connected the tablet to one of the terminals; Alpha closed the window and started to power up the station&#39;s hyperspace communications module, which had been shut off since the first boarding party had set foot aboard the station.

The array ejected a message pod, containing everything that Edgun had wrote, along with the data Alpha had collected; after it had drifted a considerable distance from the station, it translated into layer 5 space and started to broadcast continuously, presumably in the direction of the Procyons&#39; homeworld.

`I have sent your message to my creators. They will receive it in approximately three of your centuries, earlier if some of the listening posts near the Procyon homeworld intercept the message before the communications arrays on the Procyon homeworld itself intercepts it. The reason I chose this timeframe is because I estimated it would take your species this amount of time to reach Procyon space; I wished to ensure that by the time you initiated contact with the Procyons, you would already have an ally.`

&quot;Thank you, Alpha. I can truly say that you have helped us take the first step,&quot; Edgun thanked.

`There is no need to thank me. It is an integral part of my programming.`
