# Part II – Relay
## 6 – The Station

Central Information Center, KFS _Scalpel_ - Ten Years Later – KD 8032.3

&quot;Captain, sensors are indicating an anomalous object in orbit of 1451-1 R3III 203,&quot; Katbeth reported. Her console had been beeping insistently, which either meant trouble or a new discovery.

&quot;What do you make of it, Commander?&quot; Edgun asked. Katbeth&#39;s fingers flew over her console, trying to find out more about the anomalous object.

&quot;It appears to be the source of all the radio waves, Captain. The star is not radiobright; this object, whatever it may be, is the source we&#39;re looking for,&quot; Katbeth said, after consulting her console.

&quot;Ensign, can you plot a fluid braking course that brings us to a complete stop near the anomalous object?&quot; Edgun inquired.

&quot;I can try,&quot; replied Megdia. She began to run a series of calculations on her console; fluid braking was a very delicate and precise matter, and to brake sufficiently as to approach a target whilst hurtling through hyperspace at one percent of the speed of light required complex calculations.

Fortunately, there was the somewhat omnipotent computer.

&quot;I&#39;ve got it. We need to divert towards the object, translate to layer ten and open the ramscoops in one hour&#39;s time, and the deceleration will bring us close to the object,&quot; Megdia reported. &quot;Then, all we have to do is to translate back into realspace, and then we can access the object.&quot;

&quot;Ensign, send the course corrections to Lieutenant Dorod&#39;s console,&quot; Edgun commanded. &quot;Lieutenant, engage when ready.&quot;

There was a bright flash, and the _Scalpel_ reappeared in realspace, just a few kilometers from the giant anomalous object.

Edgun&#39;s eyes widened as soon as they dropped out of superluminal flight. &quot;That&#39;s one hell of a precise maneuver you plotted, Ensign,&quot; he remarked. &quot;We&#39;re less than five klicks from the object.&quot;

Megdia grinned. &quot;I was the top of my class in superluminal travel,&quot; she explained. &quot;Though, the computer does make it a lot easier.&quot;

&quot;It appears to be a station of some sort,&quot; Katbeth said, taking a look at her console. &quot;The interior is a Kerbin-standard atmosphere, though I detect no sign of life, sapient or otherwise.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to find out. Commander Enman, as my first officer, you&#39;ll lead the boarding party. I&#39;ll have Counselor Tigan – standard procedure for First Contact requires the ship&#39;s counselor to accompany the command-grade officer – and Crewkerb Lembo, the linguist, join you,&quot; Edgun said. He tapped a button on the captain&#39;s chair, and addressed the pickup. &quot;Counselor Tigan and Crewkerb Lembo, report to the dorsal airlock at once.&quot; Turning off the comm, he turned to Enman. &quot;Commander, the same goes for you.&quot;

---

The three officers suited up in the airlock, donning their extravehicular suits, along with the frictomag boots and thruster packs – relatively standard kit, anyway. The frictomag boots allowed for easier mobility whilst traversing the _Scalpel_&#39;s ferrous hull; the thruster packs would be engaged once they were free of the hull and in space. The packs really weren&#39;t needed – a sufficiently powerful jump could, in theory, propel the user to the destination – but it was better to be safe than sorry.

&quot;Everybody ready?&quot; Enman asked through the inter-suit communications system.

A series of ayes came through his comm.

&quot;Very well. Magnetize your frictomag boots,&quot; he ordered, and tapped a control panel located on his right leg. The indicator light turned green, and the boots clamped down on the ferrous surface of the airlock. The two other officers followed suit, and several more clanks reverberated throughout the airlock. Once the preparation was completed, Enman made his way to the intercom – with some difficulty, since there was still artificial gravity in the airlock, not to mention the force of his frictomag boots holding him down – but he reached it, and tapped the intercom button.

&quot;Dorsal Airlock to CIC,&quot; he said.

&quot;_CIC here. What can I do for you, Commander?_&quot; Edgun asked.

&quot;Just thought you might want to know that we&#39;re all fired up and ready to go. Metaphorically speaking, of course,&quot; Enman answered.

&quot;_CIC copies. Depressurize airlock, disengage artgrav plates, and perform your egress when ready. Over and out,_&quot; Edgun said, and the link was terminated.

Enman rejoined the group, and tapped a button on the airlock panel. The doors slowly closed, isolating the airlock from the rest of the ship.

&quot;Disengaging artgrav plates in this sector,&quot; Enman muttered. There was a small jolt, but the crew still stood on the deck plate, by way of the frictomag boots.

&quot;Depressurizing,&quot; he announced. Klaxons blared as the atmosphere was removed from the airlock. This continued for a while, since the air pressure in the Habitation toroid was a full atmosphere, unlike other ships of the time (whose cabins were rated for lower pressures, but higher oxygen concentrations). The atmosphere in the Habitation toroid was made to mimic that of Kerbin&#39;s: an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, with 20% oxygen.

Finally, the depressurization completed, and the wall panel reflected that fact. After examining the panel, Enman addressed the two other officers.

&quot;You all ready?&quot; Enman asked.

The two other officers responded in the affirmative.

&quot;Activate your transponders, so you can find each other if you get lost,&quot; he ordered. The space-suited officers tapped a few buttons, activating their transponder. Their positions relative to each other came up on their heads-up displays.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Enman said, and tapped the wall panel. The airlock doors opened, and the three officers walked towards the opening.

Enman tapped a button on his leg, disengaging the frictomag boots. With the help of a nearby handrail, he maneuvered himself so he could reach the external airlock panel, located near the doors. He tapped a button on the panel, and the doors slammed shut.

&quot;I&#39;ve closed the airlock doors. Step onto the closed doors, set your frictomag boots to the lowest setting, and give it all you got,&quot; Enman instructed. &quot;Once you clear the mesh skeleton, fire your ventral thrusters to reduce your relative speed to nil, aim yourself at the station, then you fire the fore thrusters. Is that clear?&quot;

The two crewkerbs all answered in the affirmative. Enman stepped onto the closed airlock doors, and set his frictomag boots to the lowest possible setting. This setting still adhered the user to the ferrous surface, but the force was so weak that a swing of the arm could dislodge the user.

Enman prepared for his jump, and kicked off. The force caused the frictomag boots to separate from the ferrous surface, and sent Enman flying upwards, albeit somewhat awkwardly. After a bit of tumbling, he managed to regain his composure and activate his comm.

&quot;Alright, you guys,&quot; he said through the comm. &quot;I&#39;m away. Get ready for your jump; I&#39;ll meet you near the station.&quot;

The two crewkerbs followed suit, using the frictomag boots and ferrous airlock doors as a trampoline; within minutes, they were off in the direction of the station.

While the trio were jetting towards the station, Enman was not busy. He had to find a working airlock, or they would not be able to access the station. And since the station was pressurized, they could not just melt a hole in the station&#39;s hull with a welder-cutter, lest the atmosphere of the station be vented out into the vacuum of space, further complicating exploration of the station.

&quot;Boarding Party to _Scalpel_,&quot; Enman said through the comm.

&quot;_Scalpel__here, Boarding Party. What can I do for you?_&quot; was the punctual reply from Edgun.

&quot;We meet again, Cap&#39;n. Could you tell Commander Katbeth to do an external scan of the station?&quot; Enman asked. &quot;We&#39;re currently headed for the station on our thruster packs, and I&#39;d _really_ appreciate it if you could find an airlock for us _before_ we get pancaked against the hull of this mysterious station.&quot;

&quot;_Stand by, Boarding Party,_&quot; Katbeth said. Evidently, she had heard the message over the chair pickup. Several minutes later, the comm sounded again.

&quot;_I&#39;ve got it, Boarding Party. Sending the coordinates to your HUD now,_&quot; Katbeth replied. The navigational computer of Enman&#39;s EVA suit updated, reflecting the new destination.

&quot;I really appreciate this, _Scalpel_. Boarding Party out,&quot; Enman said, and closed the channel. He opened an additional channel to the other crewkerbs.

&quot;I&#39;m about to divert my course to the station&#39;s airlock. Lock onto my transponder and engage your autopilot,&quot; Enman ordered. Two unrehearsed ayes came through the comm, and Enman activated his own autopilot.

Within minutes, the autopilot brought them to a depressurized airlock. Enman maneuvered himself over to the airlock panel, and opened the doors. The trio activated their frictomag boots, and they clamped down on the ferrous surface of the airlock. Enman tapped a button on the internal panel, and the doors closed. Another button, and atmosphere was vented into the chamber. The panel gave the green light, and the interior doors opened. Enman and crew took off their helmets, placed it beside the airlock doorway, and stepped into the station.

The station&#39;s interior was rather spartan; there were only a few computer terminals scattered here and there, airlocks leading to and from the interior, and a somewhat large screen at the center. However, something completely unexpected happened; upon the boarding party&#39;s entry, the station&#39;s artificial intelligence awakened, and issued forth a verbal message in – surprisingly – perfectly fluent and standard Kerblish.

`Relay Alpha artificial intelligence system activated. Three sapient life forms detected. Species identification subroutine engaged. Species identification successful: Kerbal sapiens.`

Enman addressed the AI. &quot;I am Commander Christopher Enman of the starship _Scalpel_, the flagship of the Kerbin Fleet. We hail from a star named Kerbol, ten light-years distant. The _Scalpel_ is on an exploratory mission.&quot;

`Please dispense with the so-called "First Contact" procedures, as you call it. I understand that you are of Kerbol. By analyzing your primitively faint radio signals, I have pieced together a lingua matrix; with the matrix, I am able to converse with you in standard Kerblish.`

&quot;How did you receive our signals?&quot;

`I am unable to reveal that. For my database to be accessed, a prerequisite assessment must be completed first.`

&quot;What is the prerequisite assessment?&quot;

`To ensure that my database is viewed only by those who can interpret it, a basic language course must be completed by anyone who wishes to access it.`

&quot;Is it agreeable to you, Relay Alpha –?&quot;

`Please, just Alpha.`

&quot;– very well, _Alpha_. We are not the only crew aboard the _Scalpel_. In fact, there will probably a few more boarding parties following ours. Is it agreeable to you if this current boarding party completes the basic language course on behalf of the later boarding parties?&quot;

`That is acceptable. You are sure that the boarding parties later are at the same literary level as you?`

&quot;Positive.&quot;

`Very well. Please proceed to one of the computer terminals, and I shall upload the assessment to that terminal.`

The trio proceeded to one of the active computer terminals, which there weren&#39;t a lot of. The AI understood, and uploaded the assessment to that particular terminal. Once the assessment was successfully uploaded, it spoke again.

`You will be given one hour to complete this assessment. The timer begins now.`

&quot;Boarding Party to _Scalpel_.&quot;

&quot;Scalpel _here, Boarding Party. I presume you have good news._&quot;

&quot;We have negotiated with the artificial intelligence of the station, and come to an agreement.&quot;

&quot;_Oh?_&quot;

&quot;The AI – he calls himself Alpha – has agreed to grant us access to his database, and provide berths for our scientists that are learning from his database.&quot;

&quot;_He has quite a substantial database, I suppose?_&quot;

&quot;Very; his database contains approximately sixteen petabytes of data.&quot;

&quot;_Fascinating. How does he store that amount of data?_&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know. It&#39;s far more advanced than our current computing systems.&quot;

&quot;_We shall have to find out. What&#39;ll we do now?_&quot;

&quot;If it is agreeable to you, Captain, then transfer all the scientists and engineers to the shuttles and transit to the station. Alpha has given me the station&#39;s schematics, and I shall set up a portable beacon near the docking hub.&quot;

&quot;_Acknowledged._ Scalpel _out._&quot;

---

_Shuttle One_&#39;s cargo hold opened with a _psshh_ sound, and Lieutenant Dorod and six other scientists crawled into the cabin through the hold. The shuttle was only rated to carry six kerbals, but another wouldn&#39;t do much harm. Dorod assumed the pilot&#39;s chair, at the front of the shuttle, and the scientists sat down in the passenger seats.

Dorod tapped the comm. &quot;_Shuttle One_ to _Scalpel_. Ready for undocking.&quot;

&quot;Scalpel _copies,_ Shuttle One_. You are go for undocking_,&quot; was the reply from Edgun.

Dorod tapped another button, and the docking clamps were released. He fired the dorsal thrusters, and the shuttle inched away from the _Scalpel_. Then, he targeted the beacon that Enman had set up near the docking hub, and opened the throttle wide.

The same thing was happening on the _Scalpel_&#39;s starboard bow. _Shuttle Two_ broke away from its mothership, and sped off towards the station. This shuttle was carrying the _Scalpel_&#39;s engineering division, along with Ensign Megdia, who was piloting.

The two shuttles flew parallel to each other, their rocket plumes fading away in the vacuum. Soon, the two shuttles reached the midpoint of their respective trajectories, at which point they turned around and started to decelerate in unison.

Finally, the shuttles reached the docking hub, and moved in to dock with the station. Interestingly, the docking nodes of the station were exactly identical to that of the shuttles&#39;. The shuttles fired their RCS thrusters, and made contact with the nodes. The bottom of the shuttles opened up, and the shuttle crew crawled through the narrow confines of the docking nodes.

The hub led to the central area, where the initial boarding party had remained since the encounter with Alpha (except for Enman, of course, who had made a brief excursion to plant the portable beacon near the docking hub). During the time the pair of shuttles took to transit to the station, Alpha had made active six additional terminals, bringing the total count up to twelve; the exact number of Operations and Sciences crewkerbs aboard the _Scalpel_.

`The terminals are active and ready for you to commence your research. After I have finished speaking, Commander Enman will show you to your berths. Meals, which are from the station's food stores, will be served thrice a day.`

At this, there was much jubilation among the crew; they had eaten nothing but algae paste and vegetables for ten years, and they were ready for a change.

`My speech has concluded. Commander, if you'll show the scientists to their berths. It is late, and you must be well-rested in order to efficiently assimilate information.`
