## 2 – Briefing

Fleet Headquarters - 1715 hours, FHST

The conical pod jettisoned its heat-shield, and popped open the parachute when it was directly above Fleet Headquarters. The computer had done a fine job of targeting their destination, but it had still required a bit of correction. Ten minutes – and not a moment more – had passed before the hatch opened and the two passengers climbed out. One of them checked the pod&#39;s chronometer.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Edgun muttered. Dragging Enman along, he rushed into the main building, and located a wardrobe containing dress uniforms. Their duty jumpsuits were fine for _duty_, but wasn&#39;t something that could be worn at a briefing or a _dinner with the top brass_. Luckily for them, the wardrobe contained exactly one command-division dress uniform and one operations-division uniform.

They threw their duty jumpsuits off, removed their assignment patch and rank pips, and put on the dress uniforms. They hastily pinned their rank devices onto their right chest, and their assignment patch to their left shoulder. Edgun stuffed their jumpsuits into a nearby drawer, and ran towards the briefing room. He checked his watch: 17:28. They picked up their pace, and arrived in the nick of time; the room&#39;s clock showed 17:29 when they arrived.

The two Fleet officers assumed their position at the front of the room, with the elevated podium overlooking the Kerbals. Edgun stood at the center, with Enman on his left flank, and the chief science officer, wearing a teal-colored stripe around her sleeve, standing to his right. The pilot and astrogator, both with yellow cuff stripes, flanked the department heads of the ship.

Suddenly, the door opened, and Admiral Hansy entered. He assumed his position at the podium, and the room quieted down. As the most senior officer in the room, other than Hansy, Edgun directed the drill.

&quot;Admiral on DECK! **ATTEN-**** SHUN!**&quot; Edgun roared in true military style, stood stiffer than a steel rod, and whipped off a salute towards the admiral. The four other Fleet officers at the front of the room followed suit, snapping to attention and saluting the admiral. The civilian officers stood only at attention; they did not need to salute the admiral, as they weren&#39;t military.

A small smile played across the admiral&#39;s face, but he remained serious. Then, he returned the salute, and gave the command. &quot;At ease.&quot;

The Fleet officers lowered their right hand, but still stood at attention; as did the civilian crew.

&quot;Thank you all for attending tonight&#39;s briefing on the mission of KFS _Scalpel_. In order to make this briefing easier for you, I will not be doing a lot of speaking. Instead, I will hand out data chips, readable by tablets, to all of you. These data chips will include basic information common to all crew, as well as role-specific information. I will now conduct a roll call – to ensure all are present and accounted for.&quot;

The admiral cleared his throat.

&quot;Alan Orburry, Xenobiologist,&quot; the admiral said, holding up a tablet of his own.

&quot;Present,&quot; Orburry called out.

&quot;Present.&quot;

&quot;Leah Tigan, Chief Ship&#39;s Counselor.&quot;

&quot;Present.&quot;

&quot;Very good. All crewkerbs present and accounted for. Now, if you would make a single file line, in the order you were called upon, I shall pass out the data chips.&quot;

The crewkerbs moved about the briefing room, making a single file line in the order they were called. As each Kerbal moved up to the podium, they received a chip containing essential information that was available on all the chips, as well as role-specific information that was restricted to them.

When the chips were all distributed, the admiral made another brief speech. &quot;Well, then. It seems like you all have your data chips. Now, I&#39;ll leave you alone to process your information. Remember: the banquet is at 1830 hours, which is in –&quot; he checked his chronometer – &quot;precisely fifty-five minutes. As you were.&quot;

The admiral stepped out of the briefing room, presumably to prepare for the dinner, and small talk resumed in the room. Some of the crewkerbs conversed each other, while others processed the data from their tablets in silence. All were anticipating the banquet – thankfully, no one had alerted them to the fact that the top brass were to be present. Except for captain and first officer, no one knew of the unexpected guests.
