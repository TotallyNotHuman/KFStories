## 3 – Banquet

Banquet Hall, Fleet Headquarters
1815 hours, FHST

By this time, most of the civilian crewkerbs had finished reading their assigned material. As trained Fleet officers, however, Edgun and his fellow officers had finished their part of the briefing fifteen minutes prior. So, they elected to copy the document from the data chip onto their tablets&#39; internal storage; they could always re-read the information at a later time.

However, now was not the time to be worried about the briefing; there was a more pressing matter at hand – the banquet celebrating the commissioning of the _Scalpel_. Admirals were going to be present, so it was imperative that the Fleet officers had to be in ship-shape and Bristol fashion. Edgun certainly was, and so were the other officers, but the same _probably_ couldn&#39;t be said for Enman.

&quot;Christopher Enman, what in the name of the moons of Jool are you doing with my hair gel? That thing set me back almost a hundred roots!&quot; Edgun exclaimed, the moment he walked in on Enman in the lavatory. He had been making several attempts on styling his hair, only for the attempts to end in disaster.

&quot;Oh, calm _down_, Jimmy boy. I&#39;ll just buy you a new can, later. &#39;Sides, a lot of use hair gel will be on the ship! It&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to be in that dress uniform of yours all the time,&quot; Enman said, spraying his hair with yet more hair gel. Edgun grimaced at the sight of the precious hair gel being vented out of the can. He made a move towards Enman, and grabbed the mostly-empty can.

&quot;Trust me, I know what I&#39;m doing. In return, you _will_ buy me that can, after we return from the mission,&quot; Edgun said, through gritted teeth.

One forced rearrangement of Enman&#39;s hair later, captain and first officer emerged from the lavatory together.

&quot;I&#39;m telling you, I look _ridiculous_, even more so than when I&#39;m in this stupid dress uniform,&quot; Enman was muttering. His normally spiky hair was combed back, allowing him to resemble someone who was going to a banquet with very important Kerbals.

&quot;I don&#39;t see why,&quot; Edgun commented nonchalantly. Enman groaned again.

&quot;Can&#39;t you see? My hair has so much grease on it, it looks like I took a shower using Sludgy Shampoo,&quot; Enman muttered.

&quot;You&#39;re right about that. But it&#39;s not my fault, is it?&quot; Edgun snickered.

&quot;Nothing we can do about it now,&quot; Enman quipped, as they walked through the door of the Banquet Hall.

As soon as they had entered the banquet hall, Enman&#39;s stomach twitched violently.

&quot;Oh, _no_,&quot; he muttered.

&quot;What is it, Chris?&quot; Edgun looked somewhat concerned.

&quot;It&#39;s just that…oh, damn it, I&#39;ve never even met an Admiral in person, much less the _top brass_,&quot; Enman said, shaking.

&quot;Relax. It&#39;s just the nerves getting to you. Just don&#39;t say or do anything stupid, and put on your best smile,&quot; Edgun suggested. As a senior officer, he was used to meeting admirals – all the time.

Enman nodded stiffly, and Hansy, followed by three admirals in differing dress uniforms, walked towards the duo.

&quot;Ah, there you are. Captain James Edgun and Commander Christopher Enman, I&#39;d like you to meet the head of the Admiralty. This is Vice Admiral Charlie Kerson, our Chief of Staff; Rear Admiral Adam Danoly, the Head of the Operations department; and Rear Admiral Phil Geofdin, the Head of the Sciences department,&quot; Hansy introduced.

&quot;Pleasure to meet you, gentlekerbs,&quot; Edgun said professionally.

&quot;The pleasure is ours,&quot; Kerson said. &quot;After all, you&#39;re commanding the first deep space mission! It is not something to shrug off.&quot;

&quot;Not the _first_, sir. Remember our numerous expeditions and colonization efforts? On our planet&#39;s moons, the Duna system, and the moons of Jool? There have been many seekers of the deep black; I&#39;m just one of them,&quot; Edgun mentioned, rather modestly.

&quot;You are correct. However, this _is_ the first interstellar voyage, after all. Frankly, I&#39;m excited to have the opportunity to dine with you this evening,&quot; Kerson replied.

&quot;As am I. It is always an exciting thing to dine with one of the top,&quot; Edgun affirmed. &quot;Shall we go?&quot;

Captain and admiral left the others, to dine together and presumably consume some hydrazine while they were at it. Which, conveniently, left Enman with the Head of Operations – the Head of Sciences had probably run off to meet the _Scalpel_&#39;s science officer.

&quot;She&#39;s a fine ship,&quot; Danoly told Enman. &quot;I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting her in person, of course; being part of the top brass and the Head of an entire division confines me to my desk most of the time – but rumors say this much.&quot;

&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you in luck, sir; I happen to have a holographic photo of her. Shall I show you?&quot; Enman offered.

&quot;Please do,&quot; Danoly replied.

&quot;Computer, locate nearest vacant holographic projection room,&quot; Enman said to the computer, present in every room.

&quot;_The nearest holographic projection room, HPR-5, is vacant and is 138 meters from your current position_,&quot; the computer replied.

&quot;Excellent,&quot; Enman said. The two Fleet officers left the banquet hall and proceeded towards the nearest holographic projection room. When they reached the room, Enman faced the wall panel, and enunciated clearly. &quot;Computer, Commander Christopher Enman. Authorization Enman tau-seven-two-phi.&quot;

The computer beeped in the affirmative, and the doors opened. Commander and admiral entered the projection room, and then the doors closed. Enman issued another verbal command to the computer, once the doors were shut.

&quot;Computer, begin program _KFS_ Scalpel _Simulation_,&quot; he ordered. The computer beeped in response, and a model of the _Scalpel_ materialized.

To the Head of Engineering, the sight was breathtaking. He had been working with ships since he was a lowly cadet, but he had never seen such a glorious sight. The ramscoop assembly running the length of the ship and disappearing into the fusion reaction chamber, with a scoop placed at the bow of the craft; the central nacelle systems, complete with translation drive and auxiliary reaction mass storage for the shuttles; the large, spidery fusion drive nozzle at the stern of the ship, flanked by two small engine bells connected to the dusty-plasma fission reactors. There was no other word to describe her; she was glorious.

&quot;I think I&#39;ve seen enough. She&#39;s a glorious ship,&quot; Danoly said, and then gave the computer another order. &quot;Computer, save program and exit.&quot;

The holographic visuals shimmered out of existence, and the doors opened.

&quot;Now,&quot; said Enman, &quot;shall we drink to the _Scalpel_?&quot;

The admiral wrinkled his nose. &quot;With what? _Synthazine_?&quot; he asked incredulously. &quot;Let&#39;s go back to the so-called Brass Room; I&#39;d like to pick something up.&quot;

Danoly started to walk towards the Room, armed with his authorization code; once they reached his office, the wall panel recorded his code, opening the door. He scanned the shared office, and let out an &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; as he found what he was looking for.

&quot;I _knew_ Hansy was keeping a bottle of the good stuff _somewhere_ in the office,&quot; exclaimed Danoly, as he removed the bottle from its hiding place. Enman stole a look towards the bottle, labeled _Dom Kérbignon – Vintage 2835 – 12% hydrazine content_, and his eyes widened in surprise.

&quot;This bottle of kampagne is older than _I_ am,&quot; Enman said, shocked.

&quot;What!? I&#39;m drinking with a child,&quot; Danoly muttered in disbelief. He opened the cork with a satisfying _pop_, and found two clean glasses laying around the office. Pouring the hydrazinic drink into the glasses, he said a toast.

&quot;To the _Scalpel_,&quot; Danoly said.

&quot;May she stand firm against the tests of time,&quot; agreed Enman. The two downed their kampagne all at once, the hydrazinic drink burning pleasantly as it sped down their gullets. Enman sighed, as he felt the hydrazine take hold. &quot;Well, you want to go back to the Hall now? They&#39;re probably worried about us,&quot; he slurred.

&quot;Sure. All this hydrazine is making me hungry,&quot; Danoly said groggily, and then the two Kerbin Fleet officers stumbled on back to the Banquet Hall.

---

Enman, pleasantly fuzzy from drinking a glass of hydrazinic kampagne, stumbled into the Banquet Hall. Using what was left of his five senses, he located Edgun and the Chief of Staff, and wandered drunkenly towards their table.

The two other officers were not busy. They were intoxicated from drinking synthazine, and the synthazine had worked them up slightly; they were discussing their Academy days, laughing at the memories. Enman, walking unsteadily, finally reached his destination and plopped down on a chair.

&quot;Where were you, Chris?&quot; Edgun asked, his speech slightly slurred from his consumption of the synthazine.

&quot;Loading up on real hydrazine with Danoly, courtesy of Admiral Hansy, of course,&quot; Enman said, followed by a rather large and rude belch.

Kerson&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;You didn&#39;t drink his _Dom Kérbignon_, did you?&quot;

&quot;Damn right I did! Let me tell you something: the 2835 vintage has got _quite_ a kick,&quot; Enman replied, and threw a laughing fit. The laughter was contagious, and soon the others began to laugh as well.

The three boys began to socialize among each other, reminiscing about their Academy days. Now, there were more topics to discuss, due to the presence of the infamous Commander Enman.
