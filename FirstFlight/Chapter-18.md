## 18 – Kerbin Bound

Distance from Kerbin: 1 AU - 1 hr, 40 min to Kerbin arrival

&quot;That&#39;s Kerbin!&quot; a jubilant crewkerb called out. He gazed at the central viewscreen in the CIC, and tears of joy began to well up in his eyes. Except for images each crewkerb brought on board as part of their personal effects, they had not seen the &#39;light of home&#39;, namely Kerbin and its parent star Kerbol, for thirty years now. While a trained stellar cartographer could accurately tell which star was Kerbol and which was not, stellar cartographers were in short supply on both ships – after all, everything within a twenty light-year radius of Kerbol, Relay included, had been charted prior to the _Scalpel_&#39;s departure.

The crew had been awakened long ago, at the boundary of Kerbol&#39;s sphere of influence – that was 120 AU and Kraken-knows how many days ago, since both ships had reemerged in realspace once they entered Kerbol&#39;s sphere of influence. The two captains unequivocally agreed on this course change, since crew morale was at an all-time low after the two ships&#39; departure from Relay; the twenty years&#39; worth of accumulated homesickness, coupled with the prospect of leaving Relay (their home for the past decade) and that of entering stasis, really shook the crew to its roots. Thankfully, they had some time in a deep-freezer to think it through.

The two captains, upon their awakening and certification for duty, had communicated with each other and decided that the two ships had to reemerge in realspace. It was the only way, lest the disgruntled on the _Scorpion_ stage a mutiny and accelerate at full engine power. Not that it would have mattered; both ships were traveling at a bit less than one percent of the speed of light anyway (the transition back to realspace had whittled off some velocity), and an additional acceleration of four _milli_meters per second squared wouldn&#39;t change anything.

And now, the journey of a quintillion kilometers was almost over. They were just a single AU from Kerbin, almost crossing Duna&#39;s orbit, and – with some luck – they would be home in less than two hours.

_Home_. For thirty years, _Home_ wasn&#39;t Kerbin. The starships – _Scalpel_ and _Scorpion_ – had been their entire world for two decades, and Relay Alpha, to an extent, for ten years.

&quot;Ensign, have you computed the fluid braking course yet?&quot; Edgun asked from his chair. They had entered Kerbin&#39;s sphere of influence already, and would hit periapsis in about five minutes. So they had five minutes to decelerate from their current speed.

&quot;Aye, sir,&quot; Megdia replied. &quot;Transmitting to the _Scorpion_&#39;s conn officer now.&quot; She tapped a few buttons, and the course correction was sent to the _Scorpion_&#39;s conn officer, where it would be put to good use.

&quot;_All hands,_&quot; Edgun announced through the communications link, _&quot;brace for fluid braking._&quot;

Edgun typed out a quick text message to Munwise: `PREP 4 FLUID BRAKING – STBY T-DRIVE ON MY MARK`.

Munwise complied, and both ships entered hyperspace at the same time. The shockwave&#39;s front hit both ships, almost spinning them out of control; thankfully, both conn officers were disciplined, and maneuvered the helm as if it were the grand piano in Carnegie Hall.

&quot;Approaching orbital insertion point, Captain,&quot; Dorod reported. &quot;It&#39;ll bring both ships near the… wait, no, that&#39;s not right…&quot;

The lieutenant whirled around. &quot;I&#39;m reading a whole new infrastructure in low Kerbin orbit. Shipyards, starports, stations… you name it. Sir.&quot; He had almost forgotten to address the captain in his reverie.

&quot;Does the old ODF still exist?&quot; Edgun asked. Dorod&#39;s fingers flew over his console.

&quot;Aye, sir, but it&#39;s not the Orbital Drydock Facility anymore. It&#39;s been retrofitted, and now it&#39;s just called the Kerbin Orbital Starport.&quot;

&quot;Specifics?&quot; asked Edgun.

&quot;Checking,&quot; Dorod replied, continuing to type. &quot;Standard Kerbin atmosphere on the interior, eight available berthing pylons and eight additional shuttle berthing ports on the outer docking ring, and approximately one hundred Kerbin Fleet personnel.&quot;

&quot;Divert course to the Starport immediately, Lieutenant,&quot; Edgun ordered. &quot;And tell the _Scorpion_ to do the same.&quot;

Dorod nodded, and sent a message to the _Scalpel_&#39;s sister ship.

Captain Steven Kirfel, commanding officer of the starport, strolled around the Starport Operations center. It wasn&#39;t a particularly busy day – there had only been several shuttles requesting docking clearance. So far, no starships – excepting some freighter that had put in for fuel and repairs, and had shipped out yesterday.

&quot;Sir!&quot; one of the lieutenants on Ops duty called out. &quot;I&#39;m reading two incoming starships, headed directly for the starport.&quot;

&quot;Give me the registry numbers,&quot; Kirfel ordered. The lieutenant started to work frantically at his holographic control panels.

&quot;I&#39;ve got it, sir,&quot; he replied. &quot;One is…KFS _Scalpel_, KF-01; the other is KFS _Scorpion_, KF-02.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t mean the Scalpel and the Scorpion?&quot; Kirfel asked, incredulously.

&quot;Um. Holy crap. Sir.&quot;

Kirfel had to agree with the sentiment.

&quot;I&#39;m _pretty_ sure that flying by the seat of your pants is a court-martial offense, Lieutenant,&quot; Edgun said, trying not to be sick.

&quot;It&#39;s this, or we risk flying into the shipyards. Sir,&quot; Dorod snapped, and added the captain&#39;s title. &quot;I&#39;ll speak in your favor at _your_ court-martial, Captain; after all, approaching a starport without communicating with the starport is a court-martial offense as well.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got me there, Lieutenant,&quot; Edgun answered. &quot;How much longer?&quot;

&quot;Glad you asked, Captain,&quot; Dorod replied. &quot;We&#39;re dropping out of warp in three…two…one…&quot;

There was a flash, and the two ships resurfaced in realspace, finally home after their long journey.

&quot;Hail the Starport, Lieutenant.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re…requesting permission to dock, Captain,&quot; the lieutenant stuttered, disbelieving.

&quot;Welcome them home, lieutenant,&quot; Kirfel said. &quot;I&#39;ll go meet them in the lower pylons; keep Ops running while I&#39;m gone.&quot;

The lieutenant  managed an &quot;Aye, sir&quot; before his captain boarded the turbolift and headed for one of the lower pylons. The turbolift carried him to the central section of the lower pylons; this was where personnel disembarking from ships docked to those pylons would converge, and then take a turbolift to other parts of the starport. Some could head to the Promenade, the commercial center of the starport; others could make for the shuttle landing pads, where they could take shuttles to the Down Starport (the starport facility situated planetside) or to other orbital facilities.

Thankfully, there weren&#39;t any paparazzi by the time Kirfel got to the pylons, which was a relief in and of itself. The crew had not yet disembarked, so he had time to straighten out his uniform.

His wrist communicator chimed, signifying an incoming message. He tapped the communicator once. &quot;Kirfel here.&quot;

&quot;_Captain_.&quot; The voice belonged to an older Admiral Carson Corfrey, still C-in-C after all those years. &quot;_I&#39;ve received a report that the starships_ Scalpel _and_ Scorpion _are due to dock at the Orbital Starport. Is this true_?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Kirfel replied.

&quot;_Excellent. Once the two captains of their respective vessels disembark, you are to_ personally _shuttle them to Fleet Headquarters. The signing of the Charter of the Kerbol Federation will be held at that place in approximately an hour, and Captains Edgun and Munwise are to be present._&quot;

&quot;Understood, sir. Kirfel out.&quot;

Just as he had uttered those words, two airlock doors slid open. Out stepped the two captains – Edgun and Munwise – that Corfrey had mentioned.

Walking up to the two captains, he asked, &quot;Captains Edgun and Munwise, I presume?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Captain. How may we help you?&quot; Edgun asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain on the way, sirs, but for now the two of you must change into dress uniform and meet me at Landing Pad B,&quot; Kirfel said, hurriedly.

Deciding against the notion of questioning the younger captain&#39;s orders, the two captains shrugged and climbed back aboard their respective ships to retrieve their dress uniforms.

&quot;So, Captain, could you kindly tell us what is going on?&quot; Edgun asked. The shuttle had departed from Landing Pad B about thirty minutes ago, and was _en route_ to a landing at Fleet Headquarters. Since the Starport didn&#39;t have any spare pilots, Kirfel himself was at the helm. _Thank the Kraken I decided to take a few Piloting classes at the Academy_, Kirfel thought.

&quot;The signing of the Charter of the Kerbol Federation is to be held at Fleet Headquarters in about thirty minutes, and both of you are to be present, sirs,&quot; Kirfel explained. &quot;I got my orders not a few minutes before you had disembarked from your respective ships.&quot;

&quot;The Charter of the Kerbol Federation?&quot; Edgun asked quizzically. &quot;What&#39;s that all about?&quot;

&quot;Now _that&#39;s_ a long story. Well, after we started building off-planet colonies, in the 80s and 90s, the decision was made to unify the Kerbol system. Each representative at the signing represents a unique part of the system; the Duna-Ike Alliance, for its ground-water sources on Ike; the Dres Belt Union, for its rich ore deposits both planetside and in the asteroids; and the Joolian Coalition, for its diverse system of moons.&quot;

&quot;Since they couldn&#39;t resist having two very important figures present at the conference, they ordered me to _personally_ shuttle you to the conference,&quot; Kirfel said. &quot;Of course, there will be reporters, and a _lot_ of them, so I think it goes without saying to watch your back, sirs.&quot;

&quot;Which reminds me…&quot; Kirfel said to himself. Tapping on his holographic console, he established a comm link to Fleet Headquarters.

&quot;Kirfel to Fleet HQ. Come in.&quot;

&quot;_We read you five by five, Kirfel. How are the passengers?_&quot; asked an anxious voice on the other end.

&quot;They are fine, thank you very much. I have a request to make, however,&quot; Kirfel countered.

&quot;_Go ahead._&quot;

&quot;Get the paparazzi guard ready. We&#39;ll be landing in about fifteen minutes, so make it quick.&quot;

&quot;_You got it, skipper. Fleet HQ signing off._&quot;

&quot;The _paparazzi guard_?&quot; Munwise asked, aghast. &quot;Never mind – I think it&#39;s better for my sanity that I _not_ know.&quot;

The two other captains had to concur.

No sooner had the shuttle touched down at one of the Fleet Headquarters shuttle pad and opened its hatch, the reporters overwhelmed them like a swarm of starving vultures.

The paparazzi guard were very similar to paramilitary police, the only difference being that they were equipped with less-lethal tasers. These tasers were only to be used at low stun, where the target would be temporarily stunned, but not incapacitated; the stunning provided sufficient time for a member of the guard to drag them away from the celebrities in question.

Nevertheless, the reporters had an opportunity to ask a few questions before the paparazzi guard started to stun the reporters.

The guards worked quickly and efficiently, stunning the reporters and relieving them of their recording apparatuses. They cleared a way for the three captains to make their way into the Fleet Headquarters building. By the time the stun had worn off, the captains had already disappeared into the Headquarters – which was restricted to Kerbin Fleet personnel only.

The trio walked to the door, but only two were to enter; Kirfel did not have sufficient clearance, as he was only to shuttle them to the door, and no more. Before Edgun and Munwise entered, they smoothed out their dress uniform, and made sure they were in good condition to meet _four ambassadors_, each representing a different world.

A nearby kerbal cleared his throat, and the two captains (Kirfel had disappeared back to his shuttle earlier) turned around. &quot;Captains Edgun and Munwise, I presume?&quot;

They nodded, and Munwise said, &quot;That is correct. How may we help you?&quot;

&quot;Ambassador Serena Debla, at your service, Captains. I&#39;m the representative of the Federation of Kerbin States at the Signing Conference, the same conference you all have been invited to witness, sirs,&quot; the ambassador introduced herself, and explained.

&quot;I still haven&#39;t seen much. Could you show us a copy of the Charter?&quot; Munwise inquired.

Debla nodded and retrieved two data chips, each containing a copy of the Charter. She handed a chip to each captain, who powered up their tablets and inserted the chips.

After taking one look, both captains decided against reading the entirety of the Charter – it was almost pure concentrated legalese, and the preamble and final chapter were the only parts even _readable_ by the average kerbal. So they decided to read that instead.

```

Preamble

We, the Kerbals of the Kerbol Federation, determined

to save succeeding generations from the scourge of interstellar war which has brought untold horror and suffering to our planetary systems, and
to reaffirm faith in the fundamental kerbal rights, in the dignity and worth of the kerbal, to the equal rights of male and female and of planetary systems large and small, and
to establish conditions under which justice and mutual respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of interstellar law can be maintained, and
to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,

And to these ends

to practice benevolent tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and
to unite our strength to maintain interstellar peace and security, and
to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods that armed force shall not be used except in the common defense, and
to employ interstellar machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all kerbals,

Have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims.

Accordingly, the respective planetary systems, through representatives assembled on the planet Kerbin, who have exhibited their full powers to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter, and do hereby establish an interstellar organization to be known as the Kerbol Federation.

Chapter XIX: Ratification and Signature

Article 109

The present Charter shall be ratified by the signatory governments in accordance with their respective statutory processes;
The ratifications shall be deposited with the government of the Federation of Kerbin States, which shall notify all of the signatory governments of each deposit as well as the President of the organization when he has been appointed;
The present Charter shall come into full force upon the deposit of the ratifications by the Federation of Kerbin States, the Duna-Ike Alliance, the Dres Belt Union, and the Joolian Coalition. A protocol of the ratifications deposited shall thereupon be drawn up by the government of the Kerbol Federation which shall communicate copies thereof to all the signatory governments;
The Governments signatory to the present Charter which ratify it after it has come into force will become original members of the Kerbol Federation on the date of the deposit of their respective ratifications.

Article 110

The present Charter, of which the various texts are equally authentic, upon the coming into full force of the Kerbol Federation, shall be transferred by the Kerbol Federation to the organization for permanent deposit in its archives. Duly certified copies thereof shall be transmitted by the President to the governments of all the signatory planetary systems.
In faith whereof the representatives of the governments of the Kerbol Federation have signed the present Charter.
Done at the planet Kerbin, the year 2900, Common Era.

```

Suddenly, three kerbals began to file into the hallway. The three remaining ambassadors were here.

Once they reached Debla&#39;s position, the kerbal walking in the front addressed the Kerbin representative. &quot;Ambassador Debla, I presume?&quot; he asked.

&quot;That is I. You are Ambassador Rodney, representative of the Duna-Ike Alliance at the Signing Conference?&quot; Debla replied and inquired again.

&quot;You are correct, Ambassador. Allow me to introduce my colleagues, Ambassadors Erwell and Netrix, of the Dres Belt Union and Joolian Coalition respectively,&quot; Rodney introduced respectfully.

&quot;And allow me to introduce Captains Edgun and Munwise, commanding officers of the starships _Scalpel_ and _Scorpion_ respectively. They will be here today to witness the signing of the Charter,&quot; Debla explained.

The two captains walked forward and shook hands with the trio of ambassadors, and then the six kerbals filed into the Constitution Room, the conference room where the Charter had been drafted and finalized. It was only fair that a document that had undergone rigorous editing in this room would be signed in the same room.

&quot;…Article one-one-nil. The present Charter, of which the various texts are equally authentic, upon the coming into full force of the Kerbol Federation, shall be transferred by the Kerbol Federation to the organization for permanent deposit in its archives. Duly certified copies thereof shall be transmitted by the President to the governments of all the signatory planetary systems.&quot;

&quot;In faith whereof the representatives of the governments of the Kerbol Federation have signed the present Charter; done at the planet Kerbin, the year two-nine-nil-nil, Common Era.&quot;

For once, Edgun could not be happier that a lecture had concluded. He enjoyed lectures – something his friends did _not_ share – but the speech had dragged on for _three_ hours now. One of the key points of the Signing Conference was that the _entire Charter_, from _top to bottom_, had to be verbally spoken and vetted for any potential errors. There was also the chance that one of the representatives would not be able to raise an objection, and if the representative discovered something that the representative&#39;s planetary system vehemently disagreed with _after they had signed the Charter_, there would be hell to pay.

&quot;Any objections?&quot; asked Debla, the chair _pro tempore_ of the current meeting.

The other representatives put their heads together in a heated discussion; after several minutes of frenzied debate, they stopped debating and unanimously shook their heads.

This was it. This was to be the signing that would change the fate of the entire Kerbol system.

Debla plucked a stylus from her breast pocket, and signed her full name, title, and affiliation on the tablet: Ambassador Serena Debla, Federation of Kerbin States. Even though the tablet included a stylus that was attached to the tablet&#39;s side, it felt more _natural_ to use one&#39;s own stylus, especially when signing documents of importance.

She passed the tablet to Rodney, who signed the document with swift, slender strokes of the stylus – Ambassador Sean Rodney, Duna-Ike Alliance. The tablet was then passed on to Erwell, who chose not to offer up his John Hancock; he printed his &#39;signature&#39; in block letters instead – Ambassador Lucas Erwell, Dres Belt Union. Finally, Netrix received and signed the document without any fanfare – Ambassador Nicole Netrix, Joolian Coalition – and passed it back to Debla, who had the honor of speaking the most famous words in the history of the Kerbol Federation. She spoke only forty words, but not a word was wasted.

&quot;By the representational authority of all planetary representatives assembled here in this room, I hereby decree that the Charter of the Kerbol Federation has now been ratified and will be enforced to the best of our governments&#39; abilities. Meeting adjourned.&quot;
