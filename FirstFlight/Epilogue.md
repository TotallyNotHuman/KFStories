# Epilogue

Of course, the other thirty-eight or so crewkerbs of the _Scalpel_ and _Scorpion_ were not forgotten. Far from it. A few days after the Signing Conference, the President of the Kerbol Federation, who himself was the civilian commander-in-chief of the Federal Vacuum Navy, issued an executive order; the order detailed that all commissioned officers serving aboard those ships were to be awarded a double promotion. The non-commissioned officers serving aboard the _Scalpel_ were not forgotten either; the executive order also mentioned that they were to be awarded an honorary Navy commission, as well as promoted to either ensign, lieutenant, or commander – depending on their original, temporary non-commissioned rank.

Enman, who had always wanted to his own command, turned down the additional promotion (which would have placed him at Commodore and a _desk job_ of all things) and was promoted to Captain instead. A year later, he was given command of FVNS _Tereshkova_, a _Shard_-class science vessel, and he shipped out on a five-year mission to catalog and explore nearby regions of space.

Katbeth decided to turn down her promotions altogether, because she felt that a rank of Captain wouldn&#39;t be very useful for a shore assignment, which she wanted dearly. She was offered a teaching position at the Naval Academy, which she gladly accepted.

Dorod and Megdia – now Commander and Lieutenant Commander, respectively – were wed a year after the Conference. Everybody attended their wedding in person – with the notable exception of Enman, who was at the time commanding the _Tereshkova_; however, he managed to make an appearance via holo-projector. Later, the newlyweds were offered a position aboard FVNS _Gagarin_, another _Shard_-class science vessel (those science vessels seemed to be in high demand at the time, due to the new &#39;explore and expand&#39; policy implemented by the President earlier on), as flight controller and stellar cartographer, respectively.

The other crewkerbs continued to serve with the Navy – with some exceptions, of course.

Dr. Merdan decided to establish a medical school; but it wouldn&#39;t be any medical school, it would be the Navy Medical Academy. He submitted his request to the President himself, who graciously agreed to fund and support him; the academy started construction several days later. Unfortunately, Merdan himself did not live to see the academy&#39;s completion; he was killed in what was termed a &#39;freak accident&#39; involving a speeding hovercar. As a posthumous acknowledgement to its founder, the main campus building was named _Carson Merdan Memorial Campus_.

Lenory, the affable cook (&#39;chief culinary officer&#39; was the official term), decided against pursuing his career in the Navy; he was honorably discharged and opened a small gourmet restaurant, named _Space Oddities_, in the backwater of Starport City – just a few hundred meters from the Down Starport itself. His restaurant was a hit, and it became a popular place for spacegoers – and often, Navy officers – to grab a bite to eat before boarding their hourly shuttle to the Orbital Starport.

And, of course, there was Edgun. He turned down a promotion to Rear Admiral and a cushy desk job, because a desk was not where he wanted to be. He wanted to be part of the new generation of explorers – like Enman, cruising around the Orion Arm on his ship, the _Tereshkova_ – but the President vehemently disagreed. Edgun was well past retirement age, and certainly not fit to command a vessel of any kind.

So Edgun decided to retire, and was honorably discharged. He submitted a request to the President that involved converting the _Scalpel_ into a museum. Surprisingly, he agreed and decided to name Edgun the curator. He was also the only tour guide for a while, since good tour guides were hard to find. And because there was only one of him and many curious tourists, tours were only available every other hour. Nevertheless, the two o&#39;clock shuttles were crammed full of eager tourists, wanting to see a piece of history in the flesh.

When other tour guides were found, tourists – both new and returning – insisted upon having the former captain as their tour guide. Edgun seemed alive; the other tour guides just described the ship for the sake of describing the ship. And they wanted to hear the captain&#39;s anecdotes. When Edgun led the tourists on a tour of his ship, he would always tell amusing anecdotes to the tourists, coaxing more than a few laughs from Navy kerbs (yes, Navy officers did, on occasion, visit the _Scalpel_ Museum) and little kerblings.

&quot;So,&quot; Edgun would pretend to muse. &quot;Who wants to hear about the landing party that ate only rations for several days?&quot;

And the kerblings would all yell out their affirmations, followed by their parents hushing their children sharply.

With this final acknowledgement to the ship that housed them for 30 years, the mission of the _Scalpel_ finally ended on a high note.
