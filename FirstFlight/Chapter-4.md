Kerbin Fleet transport - KD 7032.3

The Kerbin Fleet transport, packed to the brim with Fleet officers of many divisions, punched through the atmosphere as it headed for the Kerbin Shuttle Port at about a thousand kilometers per hour. This particular transport was on a south-easterly route, moving Fleet officers from the Headquarters, which were further inland, to the shuttle port, which straddled the equator.

The reason the shuttle port, and most other space launch facilities resided on the equator was simply because it was cheaper fuel-wise to launch from there. Proximity to the equator meant little to no inclination error, which was a good thing, since inclination errors meant extra fuel. The Headquarters were far inland, because the climate at the space launch facilities were rather…temperate, to say the least. While keeping the fuels at cryogenic temperatures were a nuisance, transports came flying in from mining colonies around the globe münthly, carrying unrefined ore for the shuttle port to process into fuel.

Five minutes later, the transport slowed to a halt near the designated runway, and began to glide towards it. Once the rear wheels impacted the ground, the passengers in the cabin were thrown forward; thankfully, their seat belts kept them from flying out of their seats. The forward wheels made contact as well, and the transport slowed to a crawl. It taxied towards the designated arrivals gate, and stopped there. Workers scurried about the newly-landed transport, connecting umbilicals to the transport&#39;s ports, and crew transfer tubes to the transport&#39;s two airlocks.

&quot;_We have arrived at the Kerbin Shuttle Port. Please ensure that your personal belongings are intact, and prepare to disembark,_&quot; the AI intoned emotionlessly.

The officers milled about the interior of the cabin, making their way to either end of the transport, where the airlocks were located. They crawled through the airlock, and entered the pressurized crew tube; luckily for the officers, the interior was filled with cool, dry air from the inside of the shuttle port.

They ended up inside the Arrivals level of the shuttle port. There were around five gates on that level, and an assortment of shops and restaurants. Of course, there was also the omnipresent computer.

&quot;Computer, locate boarding gate for Kerbin Fleet shuttle bound for the Orbital Drydock Facility, departing at –&quot; he checked his tablet – &quot;1400 hours,&quot; Enman ordered.

&quot;_The boarding gate is Gate 9, Departures level; boarding ends 15 minutes prior to departure, or 1345 hours,_&quot; the computer replied.

&quot;What is the time?&quot; Enman asked again.

&quot;_The time is now 1230 hours,_&quot; the computer answered.

&quot;So, what do you think we should do now?&quot; Katbeth asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s still an hour till boarding ends, and it&#39;s already lunch hour. How about that?&quot; Enman asked.

&quot;Is that supposed to be a date?&quot; Katbeth chuckled, and Enman rolled his eyes. &quot;I think we should report to the Captain first, and then go our separate ways; you never know, he might have something important. We are Kerbin Fleet officers, after all.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good idea. Let&#39;s go,&quot; Enman agreed, and then the duo made their way to the nearest turbolift. They ascended the lift to the Departures level, and promptly sought out the waiting area of Gate 9. Once they reached the waiting area, they saw Edgun in a yellow-trimmed command jumpsuit, along with two others in the same-colored jumpsuit.

Edgun noticed the two newcomers, and stood up. &quot;Glad you could make it, Commanders. This is Lieutenant Dorod, chief helmskerb, and Ensign Megdia, chief astrogator. Lieutenants, this is Commander Enman, chief operations officer, and Commander Katbeth, chief science officer. We&#39;ve met before, during the briefing.&quot;

The four officers exchanged pleasantries briefly, and then Edgun interrupted the two senior officers.

&quot;Commanders, here are your duty schedules stored on data chip. The first few days or so will be rather lenient – you will need time to reset your internal clock – but after that, I expect that both of you will arrive for duty on time. Is that clear?&quot;

&quot;Aye, sir,&quot; was the reply from both officers. They took their data chips, and stored them in their bags.

&quot;Captain, permission to leave the waiting area,&quot; Enman said.

&quot;Granted. Make sure you return prior to 1345 hours. Dismissed,&quot; was the answer, and the duo left the waiting area.

As they walked towards the Departures level&#39;s assortment of restaurants, Katbeth seemed a bit confused by the exchange of data chips.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Katbeth asked.

&quot;What was what?&quot; Enman shot back, baffled by the ambiguity.

&quot;The duty schedules,&quot; Katbeth said.

&quot;Oh, that. Standard Fleet protocol: any officer ranked lieutenant commander or higher are to take command of the CIC during a duty shift,&quot; Enman explained.

&quot;But we&#39;re not even command-division officers, and he knows that,&quot; Katbeth replied, still confused.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter what division you&#39;re in,&quot; Enman added.

&quot;Ah, I see. Well, let&#39;s find out,&quot; Katbeth said, reaching for the data chip and inserting it into her tablet, with Enman following suit.

&quot;Looks like I&#39;m on Beta shift, from 1600 hours to midnight,&quot; Enman remarked dryly. &quot;I&#39;ve had worse assignments.&quot;

Katbeth, however, was not so lucky. &quot;Delta shift, from midnight to 0800 hours?&quot; she exclaimed in disbelief.

&quot;You&#39;re the lowest-ranking senior officer aboard, that&#39;s why,&quot; Enman replied. &quot;Usually the second officer – which is a lieutenant commander most of the time, by the way – is assigned to Delta shift.&quot;

&quot;Oh, _great_,&quot; she muttered.

&quot;Relax, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine. Beta shift isn&#39;t much better; it reminded me of all-nighters I tended to pull while studying for a major project. Besides,&quot; he added, &quot;if you need any help, just come to me and I&#39;ll prescribe some of my legendary kaffeine tablets. It works wonders.&quot;

&quot;You take kaffeine tablets?&quot; Katbeth asked, surprised.

&quot;Force of habit, really. Back in my Academy days, koffee wasn&#39;t allowed on campus, so we had to make do with kaffeine tablets. Gradually, I began to like these tablets over real koffee, and that&#39;s why I take them these days,&quot; Enman explained.

&quot;I see. Do you think they sell them at the shuttle port?&quot; Katbeth inquired.

&quot;I&#39;d give it a try. They&#39;re pretty cheap; around 8 roots for a hundred tablets,&quot; Enman suggested.

&quot;Thanks for the advice, Chris. You&#39;re a great friend,&quot; Katbeth confided. &quot;So, how about lunch?&quot;

The shuttle, carrying the Fleet detachment of the _Scalpel_ crew (the civilians had been sent up on commercial shuttles earlier), was ready for its flight into orbit. At Edgun&#39;s persistence, however, a roll call was conducted prior to departure. There was really nothing the shuttle pilot could do; this shuttle _was_ reserved by the Kerbin Fleet, the pilot himself was a Kerbin Fleet officer, and Edgun did outrank the poor pilot. Edgun could choose to court-martial him then and there for insubordination if he tried anything; fortunately for the shuttle pilot, to even _think_ about court-martialing an officer was reserved for when Edgun was not in his usual good mood, and Edgun _was_ in a good mood.

The shuttle pilot in question was pacing back and forth in the interior of the shuttle. &quot;How much longer until we can take off, _Captain_?&quot; he grumbled. &quot;The reaction mass is boiling off as we speak.&quot;

&quot;Watch your tone, _Ensign_,&quot; he growled to the shuttle pilot. &quot;We will take off when I tell you to take off. As for your precious liquid hydrogen, just top it off from the umbilicals.&quot;

As soon as he said this, the officer completed the roll call. The officer that conducted the roll call reported this new event to Edgun.

&quot;You heard him. Initiate the takeoff sequence, Ensign,&quot; Edgun ordered. The shuttle pilot made his way to the command chair, and initiated the takeoff sequence.

The umbilical cords were released from their ports, and the crew tubes were released from the shuttle&#39;s twin airlocks. The pilot engaged the shuttle&#39;s jet-rocket engines, and the engines spun up, their whine increasing in pitch as the engines awoke from their slumber, and the shuttle sped away from the Kerbin Shuttle Port. As soon as the shuttle lifted away from the ground, the pilot retracted the gears.

As the shuttle ascended the skies, the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere dropped steadily, until the concentration of oxygen was insufficient to support combustion. The pilot noticed this, and alerted the crew of the new development.

&quot;Oxygen concentration is dropping. The shuttle&#39;s engines will enter rocket mode in five seconds; all hands, brace for acceleration.&quot;

Precisely five seconds later, the pilot tapped a button to disengage the air intakes, and another to engage the rocket engines. Unlike the jet engines, they did not need to spin up; the rocket engines activated as soon as the pilot tapped the respective button. The rocket engines&#39; acceleration pushed the passengers into their seats; fortunately, they were trained Kerbin Fleet officers, and could handle the comparatively miniscule amount of acceleration.

After some time of acceleration, the engines disengaged, and the shuttle coasted to its apoapsis. Once it reached its orbit&#39;s apex, the engines ignited again, easing the shuttle into a low orbit around Kerbin.

&quot;We are on course for rendezvous with the Orbital Drydock Facility in two minutes. The closest approach is 137 meters; relative speed at closest approach will be 22.7 meters per second. Disengaging rocket engines; maneuvering engines online.&quot;

Now that the shuttle was in space, it had no more need for its jet-rocket engines; while they did pack quite a punch, which was why it was used for the launch stage, it was less efficient for orbital maneuvering. Thus, the less-powerful more-efficient maneuvering engines would be used instead.

The shuttle coasted slowly to its intercept with the Orbital Drydock Facility. As the spacedock grew closer in the viewport, the shuttle suddenly turned around, so its engines were facing the direction of travel. The maneuvering engines ignited, slowing the shuttle to a halt relative to the station. The pilot tapped a few buttons, targeting one of the extended docking ports at the top of the spacedock.

&quot;Docking procedures initiated. Maneuvering engines offline; RCS thruster control engaged,&quot; the ensign mentioned.

The ventral docking port of the shuttle, protected by doors integrated into the fuselage, was revealed, and the integrated doors receded into the fuselage. The docking port extended a bumper, to facilitate an initial soft docking, and the shuttle inched closer to the extended port. Finally, the bumper came into contact with the port&#39;s non-extended bumper. The shuttle docking port&#39;s bumper retracted, establishing a hard dock with the spacedock&#39;s docking port.

&quot;Docking completed; barometric sensors indicate a 6 Pascal pressure differential, which is within safe limits. Opening ventral airlock doors.&quot;

Edgun was the first to experience the artificial gravity; using the ceiling of the airlock compartment, he pushed off and floated into the docking hub. As soon as he entered the hub, the artificial gravity plating grabbed him gently and placed him on the ground.

He waited in the hub. As soon as the Fleet detachment of the _Scalpel_ crew was congregated in the hub, he led them towards another airlock. This one was connected to the _Scalpel_&#39;s Habitation toroid – the command center of the ship, as well as the crew cabin, and many other things. It also had the distinction of being the only part of the ship that was habitable, as well as possessing the only artificial gravity system on the ship. They were headed for the briefing room, where the Change of Command ceremony, an ancient naval tradition inherited from the sea-going navies of old, was to be performed.
